t3_10ehc9,"My boyfriend and I live in a managed apartment community, have lived here for about two years. We moved to this city in huge part because of the lower living expenses. When we moved in, we were told to expect increases of at least $25 on lease renewal, and last year the rent increased $27 which was *totally* reasonable. Currently we pay $936/month for a 2/2, which we split about 40/60.

The other day I got a renewal offer in my email, the lowest priced option was $1051/month, which is an increase of $115 a month and seems unreasonable. I called and spoke to one of the girls in the front office and was told she can regenerate the renewal offer in a week and see if the prices change, but the manager was not around so I couldn't get any more info

What's the best course of action here? For background, we are doing okay financially(0 debt, we each have at least a 6 month emergency fund, there's money left over to save each month but not a ton), but we are planning to get married soon and the extra $115 a month is money I had mentally put aside for modest rings and a short honeymoon. Add to that, we will have about $2k in additional expenses in November outside of our regular bills... so the idea of our rent going up after that stresses me out.

My question is this -- is there anything we can do about this? I've looked up the law where I live and they are within their rights to increase the rent however much they want as long as they give us notice. I have drafted a letter detailing our excellent payment history, how we've never had any problems, mentioning the cost/risk of new tenants, etc., and suggesting that the max increase we will accept is 5%... but I'm not sure that this would have any effect. The girl I spoke to in the office basically said ""the computer does it"" and that she has no say, but I'm thinking the manager might. Does anyone have any experience with this?

t3_10x9ph,"Me [F21] and my boyfriend[M19] of 2 years and 7months have been having issues lately (some are small issues like we've had in the past, others are new ones that's starting to bother me).

We've been friends for a good 2 years before we started dating so we know each other pretty well. We may not have much similarities, but that's one of the reasons why I love him, because I learn so much from him. He's a gamer-geek and because of him I was able to try out video games that I never thought I would ever play (ie Skyrim) and movies I thought I wouldn't watch (ie Pulp Fiction, Ultramarines). 

I've never had any trust issues with him before and vice versa. We've never had this kind of issue before and I'm not really sure if I should be having trust issues with him. I guess I'm just worried because we're in a different situation right now -- I've already graduated and he still has about a year of college left. 

I know he has new friends, and I'm happy that he does but sometimes he sends me mixed messages. He would tell me about his friends and his day but I can feel that he holds things back, especially when it's about a certain person. I guess what really worries me is that he's the type of person that isn't aware of what he/she is doing. He wouldn't know that someone is flirting with him unless they tell him upfront and he wouldn't know that he was flirting back or entertaining other girls unless someone tells him. I've noticed him falling into a ""pattern"" when he talks to a certain girl, similar pattern when he was starting to court me. We started out as close friends, and I can tell that they're starting to get pretty close. Is this a sign?

I'm not sure if this is just my imagination or I'm onto something. I love him very much. I just want to make sure that this isn't just in my head. What do I do?

Ok so here is the story from what I've gathered, this happened about a year before I started dating her.
She attended a party near the end of her junior year in High School. She never really did alcohol or any drugs before this to much of any extent but this time she went way farther than she intended and ended up getting very crossfaded. Basically at some point during the night she started getting hit on by her boyfriend at the time's best friend who was sober. She was still a virgin and hadn't even slept with her boyfriend before but this guy convinced her to have sex with him.
In the morning she woke up in his shirt and barely remembered anything from the night before, but the fact that she had slept with the guy was fairly apparent. She asked him what had happened and if they even used protection but he wouldn't admit to anything. He wouldn't even say that they had sex. Soon after rumors circulated as they do in high school. She was always known as being incredibly innocent, hell she is a pastor's daughter, but now guys started asking her out of the blue if she would have sex with them if she was drunk. Also rumors got out that she was pregnant (she wasn't).
All this had a devastating impact on her self esteem and ego, meanwhile her boyfriend had gotten seriously depressed and was absolutely intolerable to deal with. The guy from the party started talking to her again. They met a few times under different circumstances, he would get her drunk, and have sex with her.
She left her boyfriend and soon after stopped seeing the other guy too. By the time that I met her she was obviously very scared to be in a relationship again. She also wouldn't sleep with me for the first few months because she was so scarred by her last experience.

I feel like I left a good impression, too. I initiated contact (I told her I didn't catch her name, because I was busy, and shook her hand and ""greeted"" her), I made her laugh, I suggested sushi to order (which she liked), I taught her how to use chop sticks (she said many have tried to, and she finally got the hang of it when I showed her. + a little more contact!), and helped her with a problem she was having at the moment (how to hook up a Nintendo through a VCR (text message)). 

Overall, I think I did well.

Problem is, how do I see her again? I've told the new girl that I thought she was very cute, which she responded with a slightly excited ""She's single!"" (which I guessed kind of strangely when she was talking about her new kitten to the new girl.)

So, I've known her / liked her (I REALLY like her) for about 3 months now. We see each other quite often outside of class. I've only been alone with her a couple times: once, we went to dinner because everyone backed out, and another time we had coffee (she brought a girl friend, FML, but she left reasonably soon.) Both times, we had an awesome time. The conversation was fast, fresh, funny...I had her laughing at all of my jokes. And we relate in so many ways. She's really confusing though. She'll text me, seeming really sweet, act like she really wants to talk to me, etc. and then just stop talking to me / act like she doesn't care for absolutely no reason. IDK what's going on.

The reason I haven't made a move yet is I always thought there was someone else (turns out it wasn't). She mentioned a cute guy she talked to but I don't think that's going anywhere.

Final note: I asked her what she looked for in a guy. She pretty much described me to a T. She's looking for a nice guy, and I feel like I'm really sincere, and would be really sweet to her.

A little background. . . I have a 3 year old Australian Shepherd. He is very well behaved for the most part. He listens to all basic commands and makes good eye contact most of the time. He is quite defensive of the yard and property. If someone comes to the door or a loud car drives by he barks and growls. He quickly quiets down when you ask him to. (Most of the time except when he is in the yard alone) He gets along very well with other dogs and people. If someone new is coming to the house he is standoffish at first but quickly is very friendly. (As long as I say its ok) He is well excercised for the most part. (Walk to a field and then 45 minutes+ of running/fetch/frisbee) In the winter time he goes outside less but doesn't seem to act any differently. I do alot of indoor training/play with him as well.

The other day my friends phone rang and he stood up about to answered it. At the same time my dog started growling and attacked him. He stopped after a few seconds (gave him sit commands etc) but was still very heated. My friend went in the other room for his phone call and it seemed like my dog wanted to follow him. We both thought the ringtone agitated him.

Are there any clear cut training methods to stop this behavior? It happened twice now with two different people. He is completely fine with the person before and shortly after it happens. It really comes out of nowhere. I have tried to replicate the scenario but haven't been able to. I have also shown him a ringing phone etc.

Also if anyone has tips about making him less defensive of the yard it would be great! Sometimes he barks at people that are 4+ houses away.

t3_15rt57,"I recently came to my significant other and spoke to him candidly about what I did. 2 years ago I had a crush on someone for about a school semester, spoke to him, hid I spoke to him. I feel like I did it because I felt very low about myself, felt nice to have someone make me feel good. It was not a serious crush/liking. I never expressed my feelings to him, but we did talk often and I hid it and realized it was wrong after looking back objectively. Recently, I had another crush on someone else, I felt flattered someone would like me, but I never flirted, never wanted him over my s/o but again hid speaking to him, even though it was never sexual conversations. Both were ones you would have with a friend. It was mostly about school, studying, sometimes about family things, regular conversations, never sexual or flirty.

I see marriage with my s/o and wanted to come to him and tell him this as I did not want any secrets or hidden feelings anymore. I was honest with him, told him everything, told him sometimes I would fantasize/think about these guys (only the second guy was sexual; the first guy was mostly just thinking about hanging out or having fantasies of him noticing me and seeing me as beautiful (kind of weird thinking back to it now)). I haven't spoken to the first guy in a year or more as I realized how wrong it was of me, and I have also cut off contact with the second guy as well.

t3_16183d,"It's a very long story so I'll try to summarize and provide details when asked. We have lived together since almost the start of our relationship and have always been extremely close. One of our issues has always been sexual needs. We split up a couple of days ago over this because he met someone at work who he immediately wanted to fuck their brains out and felt guilty and like it wasn't fair to me.

I explained to him tonight that every human in a relationship has these feelings at one time or another (correct me if I'm wrong). I too have wanted to fuck other people before but have never considered ending the relationship because of it. I feel like it's important these things remain sexual-only and no emotions involved which he has already stated would be the case with the current girl in question.

He also didn't have many other sexual partners before me so it's definitely coming into play. This situation is also something I have considered in the past without him (being polyamorous/non- monogamous-not sure?) We have also discussed threesomes and such before.

The reason none of it has come to fruition before now is because of my own insecurities with my body. I'm trying to reach the point now of knowing its my only body and working it. I'm in the process of losing 30 lbs and have lost weight since we started dating. My weight has always been a strain on my sexual confidence especially in bed with him. 

So on one hand I feel mostly okay with letting him fuck other women (and me fucking other men when I find someone appropriate) but I don't want to be jealous. I have thought all of this out without getting emotional at all so it's all with a clear head. I want to have our amazing and awesome relationship as partners and still be open to other things.

Since then, we've been doing long-distance, but it's only about a 2 hour drive (I understand this is not a vast distance). Since then, I've tried my best to visit, sometimes she does (once every 3 weeks at most, typically every two weeks with back-to-back weekends not uncommon). She can be a bit needy and clingy. I try to cater to those needs, within reason. I send care packages, talk to her often, and do my best to spoil her when we do see each other. I do my best to keep our romance.

However, when we are apart she finds herself sad and second guessing the relationship. She's apprehensive about our future because it is highly likely that we won't ever be in the same city for the foreseeable future. In spite of this, I'm fully committed to her.

But while dating a lesbian girl who assumes the dominant role would be perfect, they don't find me attractive now and may lesbians seem to have a militant aversion to trans women.

It seems that either I somehow must act masculine and have women attracted to me (hasn't worked, would rather play in traffic) or I be myself and no one will want me for at least another 1-2 years when I presumably pass as a woman at some level.

One day this girl added me on Facebook out of nowhere, we started talking, and it turned out she was a mutual friend of some of my friends and she served me one day at the coffee shop she works at.

Fastfoward, she invited to grab a bite a with her, that was our first date, and we started dating two more times until I asked her to be my girlfriend last week, and she said yes, at this point we had kissed, hugged and exchanged a few ""I love you"".

Now, one week later she told me that she needs time to herself, but that she swears she loves me and want to be with me and we can still be dating, but she needs time because things advanced too soon between us.

One thing I forgot to mention about us, is that we just got out of abusive relationships recently, mine was a 4 years relationship and hers was a 6 months relationship.

And I think my problem stems from a similar situation that happened to me before with my EX; I waited all time for her to recover from her previous relationship, but in the meantime I was the rebound and she was dating different guys until she found the one and then proceeded to dump me, and for this reason, I have this weird feeling that if I keep around this new girl until she recovers, is going to happen the same thing.

Because English was not his first language and I could tell he was a little isolated, I was careful to be nice and invite him to events.  We started hanging out some on our own, but mostly just to discuss school/world politics; nothing too personal.  He asked me out a few times this fall, and even though I assumed he was single, I turned him down nicely-- just wasn't interested.

After the final time I turned him down he got a little clingy and weird, so I tried to create some space between us; I didn't really speak to him over Christmas break.

Imagine my surprise when my presumably single friend comes home from China married after Christmas!  Turns out he'd had a girlfriend all along and they tied the knot while he was there.  I assumed that settled things, and went back to occasionally spending time with him.

Last night, he admitted to me that he's jealous of the guy I've been dating and has feelings for me.  I sort of just apologized and ignored it, but now I'm frustrated and not sure what to do.  Normally, I would just cut things off with him since he doesn't seem to be able to have ""just friends"" feelings toward me.

Nothing big, I know, but there's been some kinks thus far, and as the title suggests, the big one is the fact she has no drive to text or call first.

She's not said anything to me, and I've only found out that she was able to by her circle of friends texting her when I went to the theater with them.

She basically said that she's in an on-again-off-again relationship of 3 years with an ex boyfriend. He treats her like absolute shit, but I guess that's besides the point. She said she's not sure about dating, although she admitted to being attracted to me, and maybe considering dating me in the future. 

I told her I couldn't wait around for her and that I also couldn't just be friends. We decided to keep it friendly with the understanding that I'm still attracted to her, we're not going to hang out one-on-one anymore, and I'm going to pursue other women.

So I was quite distraught for a couple days (I had basically become deeply infatuated with her over the course of a week.), then I started calming down, got my groove back and nabbed three dates for this weekend. 

So earlier today she texted me and asked what I was doing on the weekend. I told her I had some dates. She immediately seemed to get distant and cold, then admitted ""I'm a little jealous."" In her words.

I'm really hopeless when it comes to relationships and I'd love some help figuring this out. What is my best move here?

My mom is 56, retired last summer, and kind of lapsing in the intellectual department. She's got nothing to do that occupies her time aside from watching TV. She's been doing more reading lately, even had me pick her up a booklight so should could read while my dad is asleep, but she's reading stuff that's clearly not intellectually challenging. She bought ~10 Debbie Macomber books at a garage sale and has been consuming then nonstop. She expressed some interest to me in reading something that's less fluffy, but I'm kind of at a loss on what to get her.

She doesn't seem to want anything that is too deep on the emotional scale, so I don't know what to do. I tend to feel like a book is really great when it rips my heart into a million pieces and puts it back together again in a different shape. I don't think my mom wants that.

I haven't read them, so what with them being mysteries rather than romance, I'm afraid she'll think they're ""too dark"" all over again.

t3_1bquuo,"My life is just (or at least seems to be) a lot harder than his.  My job is more intense and my boss a lot less flexible than his, thus I work more hours and get less vacation.  Although we have the same type of job at different places, mine just seems to come with more responsibility and more demands and expectations.  I am also pretty high-up in a field which is mostly men, and I feel I have gotten this far by always being better than the men to be considered equal.  I am also an only child taking care of my parents who are both ill.  Lastly, I pursue more hobbies and interests and social contact outside of just my boyfriend to feel fulfilled and satisfied.  As a result of all this, I am often tired and need a fair amount of care a support.  I don't get much time off from my job to recover, either. This imbalance in our relationship makes me uncomfortable, 

When this all started, I thought it would be a few months and then we would reach an equilibrium and maybe even he would have some problems and it would be my time to be the supportive one.  But his life is still relatively stress free, and things have only gotten more stressful for me now as my job gets more intense (we are dependent on government funding, which just got cut, and means more work and less people) and my parents' health has continued to decline.  It's been well over a year of this mess and shows no sign of letting up soon.

I shouldn't always be the one who needs to be taken care of, I feel.  His life is pretty great, I guess (except for the over-extended girlfriend), but I feel like I am a parasite.  

This is a tricky thing to talk about, especially with him.

t3_1buxdn,"We've been dating for fourteen months. My boyfriend has always been very honest with me about everything, which is one of the things I first loved about him. If I asked him a question, he'd give an honest answer, no matter what. My problem with this started about six months ago, when he told me that he liked another girl for the first month of our relationship, and the only reason they aren't dating is because she turned him down twice. It broke my heart. But he's started being honest about things that I really don't want to know the answer to, or question I haven't asked, such as telling me how hot another girl is, or how she has an awesome chest or ass, or along the same lines. Like, I get it. They're all very attractive. He'll always send me links from porn that he finds really attractive.

But the problem lies in the fact that I have absolutely terrible self image, and with good reason. I have little to no curves, and a bit of extra chub on my stomach. I'm not fat by any means, but definitely not skinny. And every single girl he likes, or thinks is attractive, has a massive chest with a huge butt and is perfectly skinny. Think Victoria Secret model. And if they aren't curvy, they're short and cute and skinny and blonde, which is the exact opposite from me.

The real kicker came yesterday, when he decided it would be a good idea to tell me he's in love with a fictional character. I freaked out, probably a bit more than I should, but I'm just so tired of it. Once we started fighting over this, he started trying to eat his words, saying that he just meant that she's ""fun to play with"". He had been talking about how she's so cute and perfect and attractive with awesome cleavage for ten minutes before, which is just suppose to traslate into ""fun to play with"".

We set her up in the bathroom because we thought the small space would make it easier for her to transition. So now the problems, she only sits by the toilet when my Fiancee and I are around; She eats in front of me but only if I place the food in front of her and only stands up after extensive petting. She will immediately sit after I'm done petting as well. She's extremely jump and the tiniest noise causes her to curl into a ball and hide her head behind the toilet.

Recently she had to move into a new apartment, and I moved in with her as my current lease ends two months before I have to move.

For the past 6 weeks she has grown emotionally cold towards me, which she attributes to being too stressed with everything in her life.  I've been supportive and tried to hear her out, offer advice if asked, and try to make her happy still whenever the opportunity presents itself.  But the relationship has been growing colder from her end, and more than once she's told me she's been yelling at me just to hurt me and act out.  She is an only child and states that ""this is how I (she) am, I'm selfish and you should know that about me"".   She has flat out told me that my presence in the apartment now is distressing for her, and its starting to make me feel like I'm unwanted here.  

This is despite the fact that I have helped move her out of her old place on my own while she was too busy at work, sacrificed my own time on setting up her (our) new place, dealt with my own family members turning gravely sick (for which she hasn't even tried talking to me about despite me being obviously distressed about it) and have been  solely taking care of a new dog we got together.

t3_1c8xob,"Both in our mid 20s. I have been sleeping with a girl for over a year now. We work together and when it started when she still had a boyfriend. It happened under circumstances I am not proud of.  She came to me when her relationship was fizzling out, and I think she needed me to see if there was any hope of re-igniting a flame of passion that she has not had in a while.  I was the other man for almost 6 months.  Then we decided that had to stop.  
We took a pause for a few months, but since we work together, we still constantly saw each other.  So when I find out she moved out of her shared apartment and broke up with her boyfriend, we start it up again. 

Things are great for a month, but then something happened.  I can't pinpoint it, but the passion is gone.  We both used to stare at each other with passion, and we used to make love with passion.  Over the past month, she has stopped doing anything romantic, surprising or spontaneous.  

I think I have a high sex drive, and I like to have sex everyday. For the first few months we had sex 3 times a day, but now, after about 4 months of this, we only have sex maybe 1-2 times a week.

I care about her a lot, and I was kind of hoping that it could be something more. She says she still isn't ready to get into a relationship, which I understand.  We had agreed at the start of this that we were just going to keep it to casual sex, but we both understood that we had feelings for each other.

The good about him: he's taken me out to dinner, parties, breakfast, etc. He texts me nearly every day. He seems to communicate well, he's told me that he is looking for a relationship and that he likes me, etc. He told me that he doesn't like to 'hook up' with girls, that he likes to take it 'one at a time.' He said he likes being in relationships.

The bad: the last time we hung out, he seemed disinterested. I felt like I was having to carry the conversation. He didn't actually say much at all during dinner, and we just went home and passed out. One time at a party, I saw him going downstairs with a girl.

I was not the most hardworking kid in highschool and therefore found it extremely difficult to find scholarships or grant money for when i actually started going to college.

In November 2011, I moved in with my grandparents. Almost immediately, i got a job in order to pay for my college expenses. At the time my grandparents were having an incredibly hard time supporting themselves, let alone me. I had been basically fiscally abandoned by my parents with little to no money, to my name. Anyways my grandparents were beginning to think about filing for bankruptcy. My grandfather was on his way home from work one day early in October (2012), fell asleep at the wheel and was killed in the resulting car crash. His life insurance settlement paid off for nearly 500k. My grandfather whom i loved with all my heart, wanted nothing more than to see me get a college education. Now just shortly after 7 months later, I'm graduating with my associate's degree with a 4.0.

Without income they can no longer buy the products being manufactured, which in turn would cause product manufacturing to recede on all fronts.

Well last night I finally got the details of what he meant. He says he thought she was perfect, and that his senior year when he was dating her was the best of his life. But that then she went to school and decided he wasn't as important to her as she had said. That messed him up, and he admits he shouldn't have believed she was perfect.

Here's a breakdown I'll try to keep as unbiased as possible.

* We each paid $367.
* The girl in the couple was preggers at the time.
* I did not physically sign the lease because I had no means of transportation at the time. I sent them the money and they signed it. 
* The lease was for August through the end of April.
* I stayed until January. An individual apartment that I had originally wanted and applied for way before I took the apartment with my friends opened and I took they opportunity because 1) They said they were fine with it and 2) They needed room for the baby
* During my stay, the girl had a job some of the time, I had a job the entire time, and the guy didn't have a job because he played baseball at the university.
*Also during my stay I paid for cable/internet to be installed and paid all of the cable/internet bills. They were ~$100/month. They paid for utilities (~$50 or less/month) and did give me some food from time to time. (They had food stamps). 
* I told them when I moved out if they need help, to ask me.
* Found out today when checking about the deposit, they claim they had to pay $400 to clean the apartment (which was already pretty spiffy, just a few carpet stains), $100 for cleaning supplies, and the guy had to sell his car to make ends meet.

I have a question about my private loans. As you can see here,  this shows my principal balances, interest rates, and current interest accumulated. 

 The 13.250% loan has a fixed interest rate, the others are variable. I would really like to pay off both my private and government loans as soon as possible, and I am trying to figure out the best way to do it.

 I am a little confused over the wording of the paperwork I have on them. For the loan I took out in 2009, the wording about prepayment is ""Prepayment will not result in a penalty. If you choose to pre-pay, you will not be entitled to a refund of any loan origination fees or any finance charges accrued through the date of repayment"" Does this mean, if I were to pay it off, I would only need to pay the current interest and the principal balance? The paperwork says that I would end up paying around $19,344 if I pay it over the 15 years, but if I pay it off sooner, I would pay less?

The other 3 loans have different wording. ""If you pay off your loan early, you will not have to pay a penalty. You will not be entitled to a refund of part of the finance charge"". To me, that seems like, even if you pay it off earlier, you would still need to pay all of the interest that would have accumulated over 15 years. Are my thoughts correct?

We hit things off really well and found we have incredibly similar tastes, hobbies, interests, etc, but failed to be compatible personality-wise. It was my first relationship so I had a good deal to learn and I wasn't exactly the fastest learner.

Anyways, we jumped into the relationship very quickly, after maybe a month of talking, and had sex very soon. The beginning was nothing like I had anticipated and we had a ton of road bumps along the way but were always able to patch things up. Things eventually got much better after a big fight and we were together all the time and loved each other's company. Towards the end of the relationship I felt her pulling away. I consider myself the jealous type and I think that's for a couple of reasons: I have always been put down for my looks and developed a generally lower self-esteem, and also because she was insanely hot. From the moment she caught my eye till today, she has always been the most beautiful girl I have seen, and I always made sure she knew that. So my jealousy of whenever she'd talk to other guys was definitely something that was always present.

t3_1gpdml,"So I broke up with my SO about 4 months ago - it was the cleanest possible breakup, due entirely to conflicting schedules and lack of time, so there was really no impetus for me to move on. We tried to be friends afterward and did our best, but communication quickly tapered off. I assumed from the lack of emotions I was feeling toward her and the lack of communication that I was getting over her.

Then this week she visited my city.

She invited a bunch of our old friends (and myself) out for dinner, so I figured, sure, why not, let's cement her status as a friend. This will be casual enough.

And it was. We had a great time, laughed like crazy, and found ourselves finishing each other's sentences like we did when we first fell for each other. It was a really fun night, closed with a loving goodbye hug.

I say loving because the second I go, reality smacked me in the face. I was still in love with her, just as much as when I broke up with her. I spent the night brooding over it, and decided that the best course of action was to be blunt about it. I texted her the next day telling her in fairly simple terms what the night had done for me - it made me realize I was still head over heels for her.

And she never responded.

I'm entirely okay with that. Hell, I'm happy about that. It put things into perspective. Four months of acting like I was okay with being friends with a girl I never even had the chance to see that way wore on me. I realized how much self-respect I was abandoning just by keeping up this charade and allowing her to be how I validated myself.

However, before we were dating, she was in a relationship that ended badly. Out of the blue, her boyfriend became an asshole and dumped her. Less than a week later he was dating another girl. The timing was not a coincidence. That relationship was her first real relationship and it had a big impact on her. 

The breakup was terrible for her and he never apologized or said anything besides ""we are breaking up"". She's had no closure. But we all sometimes see each other through mutual friends and it spurs up the hatred she has for him even more. 

She has told me that she still has a lot of hatred for both her ex and the girl he is currently with. She wants him to regret and suffer for what he did to her.

Before we broke up (at a time where I had already decided that it was going to happen), I had mentioned to my best guy friend [M/22] that I had often considered us dating but regretted saying anything and we didn't bring it up again.

Fast forward to a week ago, we went out with some friends, got drunk and hooked up. This week we've been hanging out a lot, and it's gone from ""I definitely want to be single for a while"" to ""I don't want to pass this up."" He's admitted to feeling the same way.

The thing is, my ex is a great guy. It really just wasn't in the cards at all, and I still care for him as a person. We had different life goals and passions, and I could feel myself slowly becoming resentful towards him because I often felt held back doing things that he would not want to do.

Now I find myself thinking about her more and more each day. I know there were parts that weren't great, because I can read that post.

t3_1if9pg,"From what I understand the 401(k) allows you to select a portion of your income to be put aside while being tax exempt and sometimes an employer may offer to ""match up"" the amount you put in.

How does the 401(k) money grow? Can you invest the money in the fund? Does the employer offer a rate or is the ""match up"" amount the only amount you get?

If this being the case wouldn't it be much better in the long term to invest in stocks as historically the stock market is said to have a 10-11% growth on average (so no doubt there would be ridiculous downs and ups in between a few decades).

I am going to basic training in a few weeks and is the first time i ever had money. So I want to make a wise decision.

One of the things i have to think about is college. If i decide to put aside a large chunk of the money I receive into the 401(k) then that money shouldn't be used for college as it would be deducted.

t3_1j9bby,"So since mid-July my boyfriend and his dad have been doing the annual Ramadan, as my SO is half Muslim. He does it out of practice since his dad has made him do it since he hit puberty, and naturally it progressed into just being a thing he does every summer. Anyways, if you don't know what Ramadan is, look up some specifics on it but a brief description is that Muslims cannot eat from dawn to dusk for a month long period, as well as other rules such as no touching/intimacy with loved ones, ingesting water, taking medications, etc. 

Without food or drink, during the blazing hot summer, you'd think someone would get a little moody. Truth. My boyfriend's dad is going nuts. He normally is every other 11 months of the year, but currently, it's some sort of ongoing insecurities with my boyfriend also stepping up in his adulthood by getting his licence, a career and paying bills, all in sequence. I don't know if that has something to do with it but I believe it does, as he is the eldest (by over 10 years) and his dad has some cultural expectations for him, as well as threats of throwing him out of the house, not doing enough for his mom, and so forth. To say in the least, it's very hard to witness and hear about. 

So I'm writing this asking any other Redditors if you have every had a SO with a personal choice or a parents' influence to do Ramadan, and how you (as a non-participator) felt/dealt with it?

That very day, I took the first step. I made a myfitnesspal account, and tracked a typical day for me, with no changes. I was very, very quickly disgusted. I discovered two things that fascinated me. The first being, that I DONT over eat. I do however, drink incredible amounts of calories. I found I was drinking TWO THOUSAND calories on a good day. Well, clearly I've established what I need to change most, right? Right.

The next day, and every day since, I've completely stopped drinking soda, and went into what I believe was a sugar/caffeine withdrawal. Years of drinking hundreds upon hundreds of calories worth of soda has left me more than a little messed up. I allow myself 1 glass of coke a week, and so far this has kept off any cravings, yay!

So I snooped again because I saw a text pop up from him last week on her phone.

Last Saturday night, she texted him out of the blue just before 10pm saying ""what u up to tonight?"". This is a week after he last texted her and she didn't respond. This was in a 20 min gap when she wasn't with me. She was drunk too.

She then met up with me shortly after at 10pm so didn't respond to any of his texts for the rest of the night/she got too drunk to function and I had to take her home.

The rest of his texts were about asking her to meet up etc with last text being at 1am. This is when I saw the text as I was still up and her phone was on the table. I decided not to snoop further at that stage.

She hasn't text back since then.

I know all of this because I only decided to snoop last night because it's been bugging me ever since. She got blind drunk last night so I had to meet up with my mate and her on the street and help her get home. She was in memory blank drunk mode. On a work night too. Which just made me think wtf is going on with her so I snooped when she was passed out.

Also remembered something she said to me a few weeks ago, she said

""I used to text other guys when I was with my past boyfriends, because basically I got bored, but with you I don't have to because you're so fun"" or something like that.

1.	She is extremely insecure, recently she lost a lot of weight and I tried to tell her she looked great, however she couldn't accept the compliment and be proud of what she has accomplished so far. That is just an example but it runs a lot deeper than that.

2.	 I'm not sure if her and her boyfriend want to be together anymore or if they are staying together because they have been together for so long/ fear of being alone (been together since grade nine)
In regards to the boyfriend, he has broken up with her 3 or 4 times and she always begs for him to take her back and he always does.

He just recently purchased a house with his father without consulting her on location or her desires for their home. The house is outside of the city and away from all of the things she values and she has told me that she is very upset about the purchase. (I just found out this information last night)

3.	I found she has become stagnant in her growth, she never steps outside her comfort zone and doesn't believe in herself.

I haven't talked to her in almost 8 months because she was becoming very frustrating with all of these factors. Always complaining and never feeling good about herself.

His mother is a complete irresponsible mother (she's lost 2 children to the state), and my boyfriend has never had a relationship with them. She works long hours as a nurse a few hours away from her home, so she is often not at the house. My boyfriends brother is at the house, but all he does is sit around in his basement playing video games, not paying attention to his surroundings. Now, the dog that they have is a rescue dog. They adopted him a couple years ago. I've seen the state of the house when my boyfriend used to live there, and it's terrible. There is dirty laundry all over the place, dirty dishes throughout the kitchen, open paint cans laying around, and so many other terrible things. That dog craps all over the place because I believe he needs to be let outside but no one is paying the right attention to him. When he is outside, he's often tied up on a line in a muddy driveway and will often escape. The brother screams at him when he barks (probably barking because he needs attention), and the mother is never around to look after him. Overall, I'm wondering if I should make the anonymous phone call to Animal Control, and if they will actually do something about the situation.

The not-so-good news is that we are both ambivalent about children. It would be one thing if one of us wanted kids and the other didn't, but right now, both of us can't seem to come to a decision about kids. We have talked about it at length, and cannot come to some kind of final stance as to whether we want kids or not. 

In some ways, we can picture ourselves as a family unit of two parents and one or two kids. That image doesn't make us retch or turn our head around. But then detracting issues pop up. One case is my medical condition. I have a brain tumor that is benign for now, but could act up statistically speaking, and that is a concern for both of us.

It's been a long-distance relationship (we met online) but we've spent time together in person and are madly in love and want to spent the rest of our lives together. I recently started attending college and my boyfriend and I were so excited because we had been planning on him moving out there with me (he attended trade school and is now working and has the flexibility to move). He has purchased an apartment and a plane ticket and is planning to come out here at the end of October. 

My parents, however, are completely against it. They've gone overboard (my mom threw away everything in my room back home, she's trying to convince my dad to sell my car, and she's trying to get me to pay for everything entirely on my own i.e. insurance and whatnot). 

My mom and I were always friends and my dad was the mean one, but the roles have flipped, even though my dad is still against it too. They are concerned I'll begin to completely ignore my friends and not get involved with anything (I'm in music ensembles, the cycling club, and the residence hall senate).

He completely refuses to wait any longer, which I fully understand. At home, he has only one real friend due to everything being expensive in New York City so he doesn't like going out with people. He isn't close with his family and is just very lonely. He will not wait any longer to move, regardless of what my parents will do.

I don't want to completely ruin my relationship with my parents, I mean, they're my parents and they've given up a lot for me over the past 18 years.

I have never introduced a significant other to my son since his father and I split up a couple years ago. I've tried to make it a point to not parade men in front of him, and to be honest, I haven't felt serious enough about any of the men I've dated to even consider bringing them around.

So I haven't really spent a lot of time considering the possibility of what could happen when someone finally does meet him. 

My current boyfriend and I have been together for a little over a month. I had toyed with the idea of bringing up meeting my son to him, but decided it would be best to wait until he brought it up, because that would mean he's ready for it.

He did bring it up, and now we are planning an outing to the zoo together, just the three of us. 

Here's where I need some advice, or perhaps a similar situation that one of you may have gone through to comfort me a little. 

I'm definitely beginning to fall for this man. He is wonderful in every way so far. But what do I do if this ends up being too much for him to handle? I would like to be able to talk to him afterwards and ask him if he is still sure he's interested in pursuing this relationship after seeing a glimpse of what my child is like. Is this an appropriate thing to ask/talk about, and if so, how soon should I bring it up? 

I feel it's important to mention as a side note I bought him tickets to his favorite musical as a surprise (and they were not cheap!) and was planning on giving them to him as a ""Thank you"" after our date, but I am afraid that if he decides he isn't ready for something like this, he may feel obligated to stay with me after I had spent a small fortune on him...

That was Wednesday night, since then she's seemed distant when we've texted, and we haven't talked very much at all. She's shown some interest in going out again, but isn't feeling well today so didn't want to go out later on tonight. Then she's busy all day tomorrow and on Monday as well.

We just connected and felt good around each other. Then, one night we were just drinking wine while talking about mindless stuff when she suddenly confessed her feelings for me which prompted me to confess mine. We started flirting and I ended up kissing her leading to our now relationship.

However, she asked for our relationship to be kept a secret since she has a 10 year old son and is friend to some of my relatives. She's scared of getting judged and/or criticized by people because she's ""officialy"" ina relationship with her father's son although he has never been there for her, as I'm told. They never married and, although he has denied it, she thinks he has another family because he only visits his son a couple hours on saturday. 

Even though, she has kept the fact that they're not a couple to her son. He used to think his parents are married and his father is just off to work and only has free time on saturdays but has recently begun to ask a lot about his father and the reason why he's almost absent.

I get along with her son quite well and he seems to look at me as some kind of old bro.

He seems to think that my anxiety is looking for an outlet and has latched on to this event.  I honestly hadn't thought of the event in years.

* He somehow associated the memory of wetting himself to the cues I gave him
* He's afraid of fireworks and thunderstorms and the loud ""BANG"" is too harsh of a cue word
* The word ""BANG"" sounds too close to the word ""Bad"" and he thinks that when I point at him and say it, that he's being punished for something.

t3_1u31mw,"Hello! 
Hopefully this is the appropriate subreddit for this matter (and if it isn't just tell me where to go!)

Today, I found out that I am going to be a father! I'm so looking forward to the new year :)
This post is more ""me centered"", just to let you know.

My situation is a little unusual because I am a transgender man (meaning I was born a girl).
...So with that, I have no ability to impregnate my wife (or anyone for that matter). My brother was willing to be a donor for when we felt the time was right. 
After going through legal details and lots of medical testing, My wife is now 5 weeks pregnant!

We are ages 27 & 28, 4 years married (So close to 5!), financially stable, recently moved from our apartment into a house. 

We are so thrilled to start a family. Late nights and long talks about parenting have brought out lots of details and plans. Of course we talked about my gender identity and what aspects of it could effect our child, Positive and Negative. We feel a bit stuck.
(We both agree that being honest to our child is important)

I'm just worried about their future. What if I don't explain things right. 
The facts are that:
dad is transgender, doesn't have boy parts (even though he is hairy, sounds like a boy and doesn't have a chest), dad can't have babies... so .... obviously.

Along with trying not to confuse my child, I'm concerned for our safety. 
I am legally male and apart from my close friends, doctors and family, Nobody knows about my transition. 
So many bad things happen to transgender people, simply because they are trans. I've lived through a hate based attack, and since then I've been terrified of having people finding out. I now live in more accepting city, but I can never be to sure. 

Any input or advice you might have on the situation is greatly appreciated.

Jump ahead about 2 weeks, and you'll find Kit slowly unzipping my pants(we are both needy on the sexual side). Soon enough, I get a good sucking. And a little later, she gets a good show of my finger tricks. Again, jump ahead a week or so, and you join us in an adventure:
""Hey, Jack?""
""Yeah?""
""Where's the quietest place we can go?""
""Follow me, my lovely Kit""

Fortunately I was able to cut off the water before any further damage could happen.  When I had a plumber come out to fix the pipes, he basically laughed when he went up to the attic and saw the plumbing system that had been installed by the previous home owner.  In the attic, there was a maze of exposed CPVC (no insulation jackets) pipes all through out the attic.  They were also raised about 2-3 feet in the air with NO hangers.  The plumber said it was basically a disaster waiting to happen and that the only real solution would be to have the entire attic re-piped correctly.  He said he could replaced the broken pipes, but it would just result in another break during the next deep freeze so we went ahead and replaced the entire attic and we are setup with a good PEX system, with a fiberglass insulation sleeve, and the pipes now run low enough to where insulation can be placed on top of it also so we should be good for the future.

Sorry, long lead up, but my question is:  Before we purchased our house in 2012, we had it inspected by a home inspector for $400 or so.

I am in law school, and all anyone asks about is how I'm doing and how proud they are of me. I do make pretty good grades, but I don't tell people my grades my wife does. 

I do not know what to do to make her feel like the center of attention. We have even had to switch churches because at our previous church all people would ask was how law school was going, and they seemed to ignore her. I honestly hate being the center of attention and don't desire it at all. Up until now I've never been the center of attention so I don't know what to do and how to deflect the attention back to her. 

I would also love some advice on steps I can do to make her feel like the center of my world.

t3_1wsx0h,"Hi Reddit, I need your help!

Just a few weeks ago I met this guy(m/23) and we had this 'click' right from the start. I was at a small party and I met him there. I was the youngest, I knew, everyone called me a 'jailbait' so I knew everyone was at least 1 or 2 years older than me.

I had come there because a good girl friend of mine(f/20) asked me to come, and said it would be fun. I didn't want to go at first, but she begged me to, so I thought I'd just go to make her happy.

The guy I met and I talked for hours straight. When the party was over and I was back home again, we continued whatsapping, facebooking and skyping for hours nonstop. We have so much in common - we say the same things at the same time, we feel the same way about basically everything!

Now, I have two problems here. First one is, that the girl that wanted me to come to the party, is a lesbian, I never thought anything of it - but apparently she's fallen in love with me. She is one of my closest friends. How do I politely tell her that I'm not going to date her? She's pushing me into it, I've been with a girl once for 4 months or so, but she knows that I'm not into girls anymore, but I guess she thinks she can force me into becoming a lesbian. At least, that's what it feels like.

Second, I really like the guy. I found out he was 23 later because he was ashamed of his age at first. We didn't really mention it at first because we just didn't think about it - we all knew I'm a 'jailbait' and I knew he had to be at least 18 or older, apparently our age difference is 6 years. I'm stressing over it. 

For Valentines day he's going to take me out. I'm really excited for it and if we have the same click again, I think we will become a couple. Just... How do I tell my mom?",OKFDIsAZl6Qa0m9x26f5Ao4S0uc7Ca,sup4_6b_t0.7, I'm in love with a guy who is 6 years older than me. How do I tell my family that I'm in love with someone who's older than me?,5.0

Without going into too much detail about the class, I'll just say that the program I'm in is healthcare related, and class sessions are frequent. Furthermore, the class size is very small, and many of my classmates I already know from the previous semester.

I'm having an issue with a particular classmate. For the most part he [20M] and I get along just fine. However, I've come to the realization that he only calls/text when he need something. The most irritating part is all the things he needs help with are things he should be able to figure out on his own. I, and the rest of my class, are able to do it, but he can't. At one point, he even asked me to help him cheat in another class, but I told him to piss off.

I'm trying to remain civil because we're going to be with each other throughout this program, but it's getting harder not to give him a piece of my mind.

We later talked and agreed to make a go of it.

Five days in and she wants to have sex. Being a virgin I say I'm not ready. I should add that she has known all these years that I viewed sex as something to share with someone when you are in a committed relationship. A few weeks later things were going great, she preferred staying at mine to going out on dates. Her hands went south and after initially saying no, I decided I was willing to commit to it.

About two weeks after we got into an argument. (she thought I was angry that she wanted to see her friends without me, I wasn't and she wouldn't believe me). Two days later she ended it by text saying that it was too much too fast and that she needed time to be single and alone. She also said that we were never together and it wasn't a relationship. Of course this hurt.

We have many mutual friends and even though I was hurt I thought I would play it down and try and get back to being friends. She has never really spoken to me since and almost any attempt I try to make to talk to her she kills the conversation.

I applied to a 4-year college (SUNY Cortland) and got in. I'll be transferring in as a Junior from my local community college. I just got the letter today and I wasn't expecting to get in. I'm pumped.

I also have a local 4-year college that I applied to but did not get in. But here's the kicker. My cousin's fiance works there and is friends with a lot of people in admissions.

Doing the latter means I can stay local, take next semester off (since Fall grades won't count towards a spring transfer and I already have 70 credits, the max you can transfer, not counting this semester) and work pretty much full time for that time.

Doing the former allows me to get the experience of dorm life, responsibility, and freedom.

The issue is this: she is very depressed and can't move on with her life.

She has a tendency to drink too much and I catch her with 'bummed' cigarettes.  She's made a few attempts at online dating, but has always found her dates to be dull or socially inept or uninteresting.  Personally, I think the problem stems from the fact that she has been with my father since she was 19 and therefore never had to develop dating skills...she's probably shy and would rather avoid it.

Me (21M) and my girlfriend (26F) have been together for about a year and a half.

I kissed another girl about 2 months ago, she found out about a month and a half ago and we've been on a break ever since.

She's trying to get over it, but seems unable to. Every time we set up a time to see each other, she bails out at the last minute.

I don't want to lose her - I love her so very much.
I won't leave her - and she says she won't leave me either, that she's unable to. She doesn't know why.

She spends a lot of nights over at my place, and I noticed that whenever I went to take a shower before bed, after I came back she would be on my laptop and quickly close down some open tabs. I didn't think much of it the first few times, figuring maybe she was looking at something embarrassing, but then I noticed it turned into an every night thing whenever we spent a few days together.

I checked my browser history, and she is looking at her ex's facebook. Specifically, her ex, and her ex's new girlfriend. I know that she had a rough breakup very shortly before we started dating. She was married to him for 6 years and said that he was very controlling and not a good match for her, and when she wanted to leave he put her through a huge guilt trip and made it difficult. I've noticed that about once a week she will exchange a few texts with him and be off in the bathroom crying about it. 

That said, she has told me how happy she is with me and doesn't know why she is still sad about a bad relationship ending. I figured some of it was just curiousity over what her ex was doing and who he was with, but coupled with the crying about it makes me wonder if she is just not over him.

I don't know what to do about the situation because when she does the weekly crying routine, she is emotionally wrecked for the whole night and it sucks. I've tried to be understanding and give her space, but it's not getting better. The Facebook thing also affects her.

I've kissed plenty of other people since then, so it's not like he's the only person I've ever kissed. I told him that we had kissed on the dance floor last year and he barely remembered it, which I don't have a problem with.

We also both restated that we see the two of us working out long term but he understood that I wouldn't be able to stay with him if the FWB wasn't put to rest soon.  I told him I didn't mind if they stayed friends, honestly. Just drop the WB part of FWB. After finishing the conversation we continued on with our evening.  When I left we said our goodbyes and I said with a nice but no bullshit tone ""Figure it out with her, please.""

He thanked me for saying something to him, because although he had wanted to call it off sooner, he said he just needed a swift kick to finally do it.

It  got better but not completely better, it was still visible in the back of my throat while the other wasn't. I went to the doctor who prescribed antibiotics (which didn't do much). She said there's no reason to do anything  about it unless it's bothering me enough to want surgery. I probably should've mentioned to her  that I smoke but I didn't think of it at the time. I highly doubt  it's cancer though, I'm young and healthy other than the smoking (I know that sounds ridiculous  haha)

Since then, I've been an on-and-off smoker (mostly during exams or nights of drinking) and sometimes my tonsil is fine but  other times, like right now, it gets really swollen and uncomfortable. I know that I should stop smoking and that's the plan, but for now can anyone offer  any ideas as to  what's causing this? Or any advice on how to reduce swelling? I've tried  gargling water, vinegar etc. without much improvement.

I should mention I've had tonsilloliths before but have not had any (visible/noticeable)  ones in probably over a year.",ZzGCcAhvqF0HnKxNsUjtJFadcZdyZj,sup4_12b," Tonsil is swollen and uncomfortable, I'm an on-and-off smoker, what's causing this and how can I reduce swelling?",7.0

We have always talked about having children one day, but pretty soon as we are aware I may become infertile. HOWEVER, when we talk about the possibility of kids around his family, he has also always said ""I don't need any more babies"" which confuses me a fair amount. 

Last week, his daughter was staying at our house - for no reason, completely out of the blue, my boyfriend tells us both that he wants lots of kids (2 more girls and 3 boys, he later specified), and asked his little girl if she wanted a brother or sister. At this point, she was pretty excited, running around saying ""yes daddy, I want a brother and sister!"" and he then asked her how soon she wanted a brother or sister, to which she didn't reply, but he told her ""anything for you princess, daddy and confusedbabygirl will see what we can do!"" Since then he has continued to be very blunt when i've talked about wanting a child or saying the usual ""I don't need any more babies.""

First off, I would like to say I love reading both this subreddit and r/longdistance. I love seeing how supportive you guys are and it restores my faith in people quite often.  I like reading both subreddits when I'm upset.

My girlfriend, lets call her Samantha, has a lot of issues with her home life.  Her mom is bipolar and quite frankly nuts, she has these episodes where she physicially abuses Samantha and her younger siblings that live with her.  She has gone as far as throwing razor blades and glass objects at her.  Samantha does everything she can to make her mom calm down, but sometimes this is just met with even more violence.  Her mother will hit the younger kids as well and Samantha does her best to protect them and stand up for them.  

Even when she isn't going through an episode like this, Samantha's mother doesn't treat her well in any respect.  She gives her the responsibilities of an adult, yet treats her like a child.  Samantha has 2 facebook accounts, the initial reason being that her mother wouldn't let her talk to her dad and his side of the family, but now she uses it a lot to talk to my mom and I.  Her mother knows the account information for her original one and goes on there and reads her conversations and such.  She does everything she can to control every aspect of Samantha's life.  It seems like she's even trying to break us up, but I doubt that's going to work out for her.

My mom told her that we would all come up with something together to do to help her, but I honestly don't know what kind of a solution could be presented.

The act of people telling me on a regular basis that I look alot better has been giving me some motivation...but it's been giving me something else. Deep in my mind it's been giving me the idea that if I get satisfied with the compliment...if I say ""Thanks! I've been working out"", that I'm going to feel like I've achieved my goal.  
  
Losing fat, to me, has been an asthetic goal all along. I wanted to be seen as something different than just another fat guy. It feels great to be able to run a mile or to see yourself lifting more weights than some other guys in the gym (you know it's true).

t3_24xnpt,"Dated my ex for about a year, we went on a few trips together, met each other's family and friends, and essentially lived together for a short period. I was going through some big changes with graduating college and finding a job that was fulfilling for me- my hopes and dreams were a bit unrealistic, and I only worked on and off during college so it was a stressful transition. Anyway, I leaned too much on him for emotional support because we were always around one another and I didn't consider the amount of strain it would put on the relationship. We had other problems, namely expectations of his friends and family. I'm kind of a proponent of the idea that expectations skew reality, but whatever, people still see what they're primed to see.

I think we both wanted to take the relationship to the next level but the reality is that we're not logistically at the same point in life and we might never be. Thiiiis noob was always on my case about how I needed to be more assertive and secure in our relationship, but he didn't have the gall to do the same. He's an extreme people pleaser, and he's becoming a total beefcake who's been swept by the upgrade mentality. Patronizing jerk.

I used to swear that we were made at the same time (close bdays). And If I could go back, I would teach little me all that I needed to know in order to be ready for him to come along- after talking with some of my favorite revolutionaries, because this is all fantasy anyway. 

Now, I know it's not entirely my fault that I didn't wake up to some realities until it was too late to make a 180, but it still sucks knowing that I was left because of some bogus preconceived ideas.

t3_256aaz,"I know I am 16, but I am not ignorant to the fact that most high school relationships do not end in marriage. I am honestly not looking into that at the moment anyway and for a very long time, have not even considered it to be in my future. Regardless, i found myself dating this wonderful guy and I have grown very very fond of him. I am confident in saying that i love him and i know he loves me too. He is a reserved man and relationships have been hard for him in the past, not because he has commitment issues or anything, he could just not connect with the girls he was seeing. 

Anywho, we are now together in a healthy relationship and he is going to college in the same city i will be in highschool. I am a junior and plan on applying to a university in the same city. mostly because it is a prestigious university but the fact that he will be nearby is very nice as well.  If i get accepted, i would definitely attend for financial reasons even if it isn't necessarily my first choice. 

We have talked over things vaguely and he says he would really like to stay with me in college. I completely understand if his mind changes and have took tiny steps in preparing myself to let him go should he choose to break up after summer.

Recently, I found several emails on his account responding to casual encounters ads on Craigslist and also some concerning Facebook messages. 

When I confronted him about it, he told him that he is addicted to the ""hunt"" and the ""rush"" of seeking out a woman to have sex with. He admitted to me that he needs multiple sexual partners. He suggested a healthy way to fulfill this drive is for us to have an open relationship. 

I have attempted to bring myself to doing a couples swap or swinging type thing, but I just couldn't bring myself to it. For whatever reason, I am just not completely comfortable with the notion of an open relationship.

Now that we spend all days together, we seem to bicker a lot.  In addition to the bickering, we'll have long 2+ hour arguments (at least once a week.  Sometimes 2 days in a row) that always, ALWAYS end with me thinking ""this is fucking crazy"" and just apologizing and eating my words and feelings to settle down the argument.  

In 11 months, I don't think once she's started the compromise/apology/or anything to end the argument.  She thinks I'm generally selfish and that I ""paint her out to be a bitch.""  And sometimes she'll straight up lecture me like I'm a child.

One day, without thinking it through, I bring breakaway shorts (i.e. with buttons on the sides) to change into for class. Naturally, flag football is that day's activity. 

So we head out onto the field for our game. It is a beautiful day. The sun is shining; I distinctively remember a cool breeze. The girl's gym class walks the track around field while we play. 

I deliberately avoid the ball most of the game. We have about 10 minutes left to play and our QB sends me a pass. I *tried* to drop it but the pass was too perfect to play it off. So I bolt for the endzone, with (I'll call him) Nick's bitch ass chasing me. So I run it in and we all cheer, but fucking Nick is compelled to complete his defensive duty and take my flag.

You know what fucking happened. Goddamn Nick grabbed a fistful of flag and shorts, and with a seriously unnecessary flourish ripped it all away.

Sadly, my twin died when we were around seven,  but my sister survived both the brain cancer and the pancreatic cancer that sprang up on us about five years ago.

Surprisingly still, she survived that as well, but as far as I can surmise, some of the tumor was not removed and it ended up growing around the stomach. Recently, she has barely been able to eat more than a bite for the entire day and if she tries, she ends up throwing everything up. She's nearing barely eighty pounds and is always in pain.

t3_28oibv,"I decided yesterday to leave my window open with a fan in front of it to let some fresher, cooler air in. It was open all day and kept the place relatively livable. At bedtime (aka 3 am) I go to my comfortably cool bedroom. I remember that the screen to my window had fallen off last summer. I think, ""phew, lucky the cat didn't go jumping out a two story window huh."" I close the window, take off my pants, turn off my fishtank light and get in bed while calling my girlfriend on facetime. 
SOMETHING hits me in the face. It's dark, I don't know what it is. Figure it was a piece of hair or something dumb like that. But it keeps happening, as my girlfriend laughs at me freaking out from her safe distance inside my iphone. Finally, the thing that hit me in the face appears in the light of my phone, which it's clearly attracted to. It's a moth. I laugh it off and turn on the light so I can squish the motherfucker and sleep tight. As I turn on the light another one hits me in the face. I kill the one that's landed on the wall next to me, and go looking for the other one.

t3_28uhvj,"My best friend that I've known for most of my life got married yesterday and I was his best man. His wife's sister was the maid of honor. Just to give you an idea of the age range of everyone, the bride and groom are both 24.

Anyway, I live a state over from all of them so I visited for all of last week. Since most of the time was spent doing last minute wedding prep, I ended up spending a lot of time with the maid of honor. I had met her a few times before this past week, but this was the first time we spent any substantial time together. 

Long story short, some innocent flirting took place and now I can't stop thinking about her. It's been 3 years since my last relationship and I haven't even had feelings for anyone since then. A few things weird me out about this situation/tell me this isn't and shouldn't be going anywhere:

1. The age difference. I've graduated from college and she hasn't even started her senior year of high school.

2. She has a semi-serious boyfriend (as serious as you can be in high school, I guess). I've never met him.

3. This all hits to close to home. I've started considering the long-term when it comes to relationships because a lot of my friends are starting to get engaged or married, and dating my best friend's wife's sister just seems weird to me.

Despite all that, I can't deny that I like her. It could partially be because I'm lonely or haven't had romantic interaction in 3 years, but regardless, the feelings are there.

One of my close friends [17/f] broke up with her boyfriend (another friend of mine) because he treated her like shit etc. She called me [17/m] up before she did it because she wanted me to be at her house for emotional support. We hung out for a short while but I had to get home before it was too late because I had work really early in the morning. The next day (yesterday) I got off at 12 (short shift) and went over to her house because she wanted to hang out again. We started watching a bunch of movies (we have a giant list that we want to watch because one of us hasn't seen it), but halfway into the second movie we were a bit buzzed from wine (not enough to cloud judgement) and we started playing this weird game (or whatever the fuck it would be) where we try to not have the other person blow in your ear and the one who was trying to blow into the other's ear was ""losing"". Idk, shit was weird. Anyways, this led us to a lot of contact and getting very close to each other. There were points where I was so close I could feel our lips slightly touching and I wanted to kiss her so, so bad (and I think she might have wanted to as well) but I didn't. Once we both started to lose energy we just lied down on the couch and started kind of spooning while she was grasping my hand. This part was post buzz (about 4 hours after alcohol kicked in).

I loved that day. We had so much fun. I want to start a relationship with her. I felt the same way about her 9 months ago but I thought I was over her. But I know it's wrong. It's wrong because she just got out of a relationship and it's wrong because her ex is one of my friends.

t3_2b8cg5,"Bear with me here, there is a bit of a story. 

So I am a part time manager at my movie theater job (one step above staff member), My general manager has a ""managers can't even be friends with staff"" rule which I frequently ignore. In my opinion he has no say over what I do when I'm not at work as long as it's not effecting my job performance. 

The other day I was working as the only Manager on duty and I spent a lot of the day talking to this one guy, we'll call him Joe. Joe and I often talk a lot on shifts but never really about anything personal, more like latest movies, what we did on the weekend etc. 

At the end of his shift I brought Joe into the office to balance his cash drawer and he waited until we were in there alone and said out of no where ""Do you want to see deliver us from evil""

I didn't think anything of it and responded by saying ""I do want to see it, I like scary movies but none of my friends will ever watch them with me.""

To which he responded ""because I kind of want to see it..."" At that point someone else knocked on the door and we weren't alone in the office anymore so that was it. 

Now he's away on a family trip for the next 2 and a half weeks.

t3_2be5c1,"This is my first relationship, so all the things about breakups that I know of are entirely from asking around or reading up on it. I have no first hand experience.

I broke up with my girlfriend stating very plainly that although I still loved her very much, I couldn't see a future for us and I didn't want to prolong our relationship because every passing day will only make the inevitable separation that much worse.

She's a romantic, and told me during the breakup that while she wasn't going to stop me, she believed that there is only one special person for every person out there, and I was that for her. I know this is probably her youth talking, but knowing her, she takes the stuff she says way more seriously than the average girl. 

I'm afraid she'll take it very hard and her process of recovery will be much longer than it should be. Hell, I'm afraid she might never actually let this go. I don't know.

I feel extremely guilty because she's begged me to come back since, and I told her a straight out no, because I didn't think the relationship would last long after this. It's only been a few days, and I'd say I've made significant progress recovering (it's been very tough though), but she hasn't turned up to school or spoken to many people. She only confided in a couple of friends and bawled her eyes out at them.

My friends told me that most breakups are one-sided anyway and it was inevitable that I'd be the asshole in the situation. But that's not really what I care about. How do I handle this? She still very much expects that somehow sometime I'll be running back to her. I've made my decision and I'm adamant that I won't, so how do I help her find ""closure"" without destroying her completely?",gMlGeJl1vsMERrbmC7W717zpVevUh8,sup4_6b_ppo_rm4_6b," I broke up with my girlfriend, she still very much expects me to come back.

t3_2blhi2,"I have a problem with running and am hoping to hear that my problem is fairly common and that there's an easy solution. I'm not sure. 

I am currently training for my first half- and full-marathons, in Chicago this September and October. I have been running consistently for the last few months. Maybe not as much as I should, but running 8 miles at 80 minutes was no problem and something I did a few times per week. I had a 14 miler that had some walking, and many shorter ones. 

Two weeks ago I left to do some traveling. I packed my gear and intended to do some serious running while away. But I was quickly frustrated because I couldn't seem to run more than 2 miles without losing all steam. At first I thought I just had a bad day. But it's been two weeks now, and not once have I managed three straight miles. 

These are all my guesses: 

1. Switched time of day that I run: I was running late mornings, early afternoons. During my trip, I had to shift to the early mornings. I figure this was needed anyway, since the half and full marathons are morning runs. 

2. Change of bed? 
3. Stress due to travel? This was all in the northern midwest, though, so I wasn't grappling with significant climate or elevation changes. 
4. Change of diet? I had been eating fairly lean before, but then was wiped out by a hard run for days at a time. A friend told me I should be eating a lot more. I increased my diet, and my running plummeted. 
5. Reduction in alcohol consumption. Yeah, this one is weird. I was drinking too much and cut way back, down to nothing for a week (which is a long time for me). Energy plummeted a few days later. 

Any thoughts? Anyone have a similar experience? Should I be worried?",9UQLCFxeYndGNfHEUP3yRt8XZhrrPr,sup4_ppo_rm4," Was running consistently, but couldn't manage 3 straight miles consistently.

t3_2bm06n,"Hey, first time post on here and I'm unsure how to handle myself.

About last October (in 2013) I broke up with my long time girlfriend. We dated for about 6 years, throughout most of high school and a large portion of college. She was the first girl I dated and I really did care for her. I broke up with her because we were both abusive towards each other, physically (nothing extremely drastic but I have a scar on my arm because of her) and verbally.

We decided to stay friends after the break up and all seemed to be going well. However, I noticed that almost immediately (within like 2 weeks) after we broke up this guy she met from a club started hitting on her. She claims to have no attraction towards him but anyone with a pair of eyes can see there's a mutual attraction. Now I don't like this guy because he was hitting on her while we were still dating. I just got onto Facebook today to see her and a picture of him together celebrating his 21st birthday.

I know I'm the one that broke it off and it's my fault for doing so, but I can't help but feel...betrayed? Is that normal? How should I handle myself? I feel like I want to punch something, as I still find myself caring for her, but that would only break my hand.

t3_2c43bh,"A quick summary about me [30M] - over a year ago I ended a long term relationship that I was in that was very unhealthy. There was a lot of manipulation, and even though I was glad to be out of the relationship, it took me about a year to recover from it. I have rebuilt my confidence and now I have an ecosystem of happiness again. I couldn't be happier with life.

Fast forward to a few months ago I met a beautiful girl [23F] and we instantly hit it off. The only problem was - she lives in another state, but has family here and was in town visiting. Regardless, we exchanged numbers. About a month later, she visited her family again and we hung out a couple of times. It was fantastic and I really started to like her. She came over again about a month later on another visit and we spent a couple more days hanging out, and I am beginning to fall for her. I like her a lot and we get along in an almost unreal capacity.

All should be good, right? Well, lately I have been having a hard time accepting the long distance portion of it. I only see her for a couple of times a month and when I am not with her, I miss her a lot. She has expressed interest in moving to my state, but I can't help believe it's solely for me and I don't want her to do that. 

Not only that, but I am **just** starting to become happy and independent again and I fear getting back into a relationship this quickly might undermine that. A part of me wants to live my own life and be free and pursue a relationship much farther in the past. She has expressed that she is serious about me and wants to become an item.

We were strong long distance, but once we were both back it wasn't the same. We were hours apart but we would travel to each other on weekends.

It came to a head a few days ago so we took a break for a few days. When we talked last night we both admitted it was over. We talked about how good things once were, how happy we were that we met each other, and how it was sad to see it end. There was no talk of a possibility of a future.

t3_2dhw30,"Sorry in advance for any bad grammar or typos, using my phone.

My wife and I are in the process of buying a house (and are currently under contract). The house was rebuilt brand new within the past few years, and we knew we just had to have it when we saw it. The process has been relatively painless up to this point, including the resolution of several things from the home inspection process.

Fast forward to yesterday: law office sends over a correspondence letting us know that one of the sellers has died, but the remaining spouse still intends to move forward with the sale. Instant remorse and sorrow set in; despite hardly knowing the person. Then my wife brings up a valid point: what if the person died in the house? Will we still be comfortable to move forward ourselves, given that knowledge? I dismissed this, figuring hey the sellers are young, it probably was an accident of some sort (not trying to sound insensitive here, just trying to get my point across).

I spoke to our lawyer last night, and basically was told that we are in a binding contract, and (barring a homicide or wrongful death in the house of sorts) would need to move forward so long as the seller wishes to move forward. Outside of this, we would need to involve a litigator, and that will create a huge headache I an sure.

Now, we just found out that the seller did indeed die in the house (suddenly).

I don't know how to feel or what to think. Maybe we're overreacting? My wife is more disturbed over the situation then I am, but I still feel unrest. Any and all advice or constructive criticism is welcome. Are we right to feel this way?

t3_2dk6dr,"Hey guys and gals I'm planning a trip and wanted to hear some suggestions and input from you all. I will describe myself and what I am looking for based on my research as well as I can.

Myself:

I am a 23 y/o white male living in Atlanta and from Florida originally. My previous trips out of the country have all been to either Europe or the Caribbean and while I enjoyed them I am looking for something different this time. I really like the outdoors, wildlife, and thrill seeking. I used to swim and love all forms of water, but also enjoy a good mountain or rain forest. I took a couple years of spanish and could get to a passable level if necessary. I have a lot of vacation days to use before the end of the year and right now am planning on taking two weeks off for this trip.

What I am looking for:

The above section applies to this one as well but I will try to go more in depth here. The best way I have found to describe what I'm looking for is an adventure. I haven't done well in pinning specific activities to how I want this trip to make me feel, which is why I'm asking you wonderful people, but I want to feel any or all of these: awestruck, humbled, risky, unconstrained, unfamiliar. I would like to go some place where I can see/experience a good variety of things and places during my trip, which means I wouldn't stay in one place for more than a couple days. I would prefer to avoid extra flights once there, but if it would open up a lot of opportunities I would consider one halfway through. I think that optimally I would rent a motorcycle or something (and drive a few hours every couple days)as this would fulfill several of my interests(variety of places, unconstrained, (slightly) risky, adventure).

While I'm not interested in marriage and kids, I am interested in building a life together and it seems challenging to do with him. Last year he quit his job because it was unfulfilling and I was supportive of him taking the time to find out what he wants to do. The year has gone by and it's hard not to notice that he hasn't made much progress. His biggest breakthrough has been that he wants to create art and doesn't care which means it takes to support himself. Even settling on a career in art wouldnt bother me, but he just wants to create art and is not interested in making a career out of it. Doesn't want any kind of career it seems, but I find myself embittered by how selfish that feels, because I work so many hours.

Long story short he just refuses to think about any practical parts of life, how to sustain a life financially (maybe because he is willing to get help from his parents when he needs it?). In the meantime, I want to be able to plan trips, live together, invest in a dog, etc. Every element that requires planning seems impossible. I get frustrated by the thought of everything falling on my shoulders, but I also appreciate the emotional support and distraction he provides me from my career-driven life.

I was trying to fall asleep a bit earlier than usual (around 11PM) because I had a job interview at 9AM, but kept waking up every 5 minute because of this one fucking mosquito that would just pierce through my skin and bounce without even getting a decent meal from my vasculature. My girlfriend, who is a deep sleeper, had already fallen asleep at the time but I could tell she was distressed because she was unconsciously scratching herself from the mosquito bites. This mosquito would not leave us the fuck alone and around 1AM, I tried to catch it by using my phone light to attract this fucker but he was so elusive that I had failed countless times. I decided enough was enough and went full psycho. I turned on all the lights (my girlfriend was still sleeping), and it took me a while but I searched every corner of my room until I found this small ass mosquito that looked fat as fuck from all the blood it had drained from my precious body. I didn't want to kill it right away because that just didn't seem fair for the both of us. It took me another 30 minutes to capture this bastard in my bathroom and I tossed some green GoldBond (I use it to cool my balls after a shower) on to this fucker thinking it would slow it down. I kept peppering this fucker with GoldBond and missed so many times until my bathtub and my girlfriend's bright pink towels were completely caked with this magical shit. The GoldBond seemed to do pretty well in slowing it down because I finally caught one of its legs with a tweezer and proceeded to torture and dissect it. By the time I went to bed, it was around 5AM and took me another hour to fall asleep from the adrenaline and stress the mosquito had caused me. I didn't wake up for my job interview.

I got really depressed pretty much right away and in an effort to keep myself sane I turned all of my normal running energy to strength training. I had been running about 25 miles per week, 5 days per week, and did two short (15 minute) basic calisthenics workouts on short run days.

When I had to stop running I started working out 4 days a week doing about 30-40 minutes on a hill climber set to maximum incline and resistance and was doing about 30-40 minutes of core and upper body strength training. Over the last 5 weeks, no running, I have unintentionally dropped about 3 pounds with no dietary change. I tripled the number of push up I can do and I quadrupled the length of time I can hold plank.

But here's the amazing part- today I went out for my first run since July 19th and I felt so good and so light, yet strong. I felt fast but I told myself that it was probably just because it'd been so long. But when I checked my pace at the end- sure enough it was about 25 seconds faster than my old ""normal"" pace.

t3_2g057c,"Hey all, I was hoping to get some dating advice about a tricky situation I have gotten myself into over the last month.  I have been dating an awesome, attractive girl for about a month now who is exactly my type and see her every other day ~15 dates. We have been doing everything together including 3 day camping trips, cooking dinner for each other, and other various activities.

Of course when I think that I found the perfect girl there has to be a problem.  This one started when we first started seeing each other and she said that she wanted to take it slow as far as waiting to have sex (that's fine).  I have to admit that I am crazy attracted to this girl and it takes every effort that I have to not touch and kiss her every time I see her.  She says i'm perfect for her and shows no lack of interest other than sexual.

So we waited around 12ish dates until we finally slept together on a camping trip.  This was two weekends ago and shes back to not sleeping with me, not handsy, etc etc.  The sex was ok, but it felt very passive and kind of just seemed like she was appeasing me.

Now I really like this girl.  But no sex in a relationship is just something that I don't think I can live with right now.  She makes me feel guilty and whenever I try to go below the belt she will say something snooty like ""can I help you?"" She is by no means inexperienced and has had double the partners I have (~20) so I do not believe that is the issue.  The only thing I can think is that she is not attracted to me in the physical sense.  If this is already an issue so early on I can't help but think what it would be like in 6 months to a year.

After trying to drastically limit our communication for several post break-up months, we finally admitted that we still very much had feelings for each other.

I deal with some insecurity and depression for which I'm supposed to be taking meds.

Her distance and the tweets deviated enough from her normal behavior that I finally addressed it on Skype, and she eventually admitted that she had these intense feelings of depression and external pressure and was in therapy for her issues, but for the most part refused to elaborate beyond that.

I broke up with him last Thursday (it was very civil, he didn't try to get me to change my mind, it's very obvious he's no longer interested) and he is in the process of moving out. He's not staying at my house, he is just packing on the weekends (while i stay at my sisters) and should be out by the end of this weekend.

I have been talking to my ex lately about my breakup and he's really been supportive. Not like a ""I want to get in your pants"" supportive, but just a really great listener. He's probably one of my best friends, but I really want to fuck him. In fact we've talked about it. Neither of us want to date again, we just both agreed it was like the best sex ever. My question is - do I go down the sticky friends with benefits road with my ex? I don't want to ""ruin"" our friendship, but we've already had sex before and I kind of feel like this would make our friendship stronger. He's the most open person ever sexually, we explore all kinds of fantasies.

t3_2k2cgk,"I love him. I know I do, he's amazing, and I can't get enough of him.
But I feel like there's always SOMETHING I'm unhappy about.

1. I feel like he just doesn't want to have sex that much anymore. When we hang out, at some point I'll start kissing his neck, touching him, etc. But he's never into it, ever. He'll only start fooling around once I complain. He loves me, he loves cuddling and kissing, but he's simply not as active as me, and whenever we do have sex, he cums first and leaves me hangin.

2. he's never romantic, never does cutesy things, all he ever wants to do is sit in his room. Which is nice, we cuddle and stuff, but I like going out and doing things. He never wants to do anything. 

3. If I don't drive to see him, I don't see him.He doesn't have a car, which sucks, since he lives around 30 minutes from me, which isn't too far, but I have to be the one to go out and see him, which is a pain sometimes. I haven't seen him in two weeks because I haven't been able to go out to see him, and he won't do anything to try.

I've been patient with him, he didn't have a job for a few months, I've paid for everything, drove us everywhere, anything i wanted to do i had to drive, pay, etc. I just feel like I'm doing EVERYTHING in this relationship.
I'm stressed, and extremely unhappy.

BUT.

When I see him I get so happy, I love him so much, I know I do. But I'm just so unhappy with the relationship. HELP! I don't know what to do.

t3_2k3zi1,"I share an apartment with my boyfriend. There are two spare bedrooms which are a constant rotation of friends-in-need. We recently invited a friend to stay with us while she figures out what her next step in life is. 

Now, I want people to feel at home in my apartment, but she keeps moving things around so we can't find them, using things that aren't hers, and ruining our possessions. Her version of an apology is an explanation of her actions followed by, ""So I'm sorry if I am guilty, but I don't think I am.""

Last Sunday I got around to sorting through laundry she took it upon herself to wash. She ruined an expensive pair of fingerless mittens knit with alpaca yarn and she lost a prized shawl, gifted to me for being the Maid of Honor in my best friend's wedding this past summer. When I explained as much, and how I knew she was the guilty party, she insisted it wasn't possible she was at fault, and if she was, I shouldn't be upset with her for things she did weeks ago. 

You can understand, I'm pretty annoyed and generally disinterested in her disrespect. 

So I'm keeping all of her clothes that were mixed in my laundry that she washed. I won't even wear any of it, but if she feels no remorse losing my shawl, I don't feel too guilty either.",dL2Aff39094mOhTKsLkJg8sCCFbirW,ref," New roommate washed my laundry without asking ""to help me out"" and is unapologetic when I point out that she ruined some irreplaceable items, so I'm keeping her clothes that got mixed into the load.",7.0
t3_2k60r6,"Tomorrow, my friend is going to take a pregnancy test. We're both 20 and in college. In my opinion, I believe she might be pregnant. No matter how often I try to educate her, this isn't the first pregnancy scare she's had. This time, however, she forgot to take Plan B, and it's been over a week since she missed her period. We calculated she had unprotected sex twice right when she was ovulating.

I am the only person she confided in about this. I keep telling that I'm here for her, and that we'll figure it out together, and she doesn't have to face this alone. However, I'm internally freaking out. My inner religious upbringing is coming out. The closer this day, the more I'm like ""What is God going to think of me if I accompany this girl to planned parenthood to get an abortion?""

Now, since coming to college a year ago, I was finally in a safe place where I could admit to myself I was a lesbian, and not freak out about it and try to beat it out of me with religion. So I've been working on trying to figure out my own beliefs about things, and not just what my family thinks.

Now I really don't need any ""God doesn't exist"" type responses because these are my beliefs, and it's actually getting to me. I want to be supportive to my friend, since she decided she could confide in me out of our entire group of friends to help her through this difficult time. 

However, in supporting her, I don't know how to figure out how to deal with how guilty I feel. I know scientifically, it's not an actual being.

t3_2kejx9,"This was yesterday.  I got on the Metro rail in downtown LA headed towards north Hollywood. I found a seat in the back.  Soon after the train left the station a commotion began near the middle of the train car.  A little old man in a suit was standing and yelling (in what I think was Farsi) at a middle aged guy who looked like a pimp who was sitting down.  He was wearing a lot of gold &  sunglasses & a flashy shirt.  Imagine the old man from 'Up' yelling at Samuel L. Jackson.  The pitch of the conflict was starting to rise and I sprung into action.  I immediately stood and walked directly to where the confrontation was taking place (I'm a big guy).  As I walked through the train car, I noticed a kid had begun filming the men on his phone.  When I got there, I stood across the train car from the two men and just stared past them and did nothing.  They both saw me approach and expected me to do something. I did nothing, but my presence was known.  The old man was seething and muttering under his breath.  The pimp looking guy was smiling.   After a moment, I looked the old man in the eye, and then the pimp guy.  The argument stopped and we all stayed there in silence as people came on and off the train, until the last stop.  It was kind of awkward and I wished one of them would move.  At the last stop I moved across the train to make sure they got off before I did.  In my head I was a train Marshall.  The old man said one more thing to the guy as he exited and then they walked to opposite sides of the station.  Fight averted.

This is not my first rodeo. I have a daughter from a previous relationship and I have no problem starting conversations with those I'm interested in or even strangers for that matter.

I was still a virgin and had it bad for my female flat mate. There were 4 of us sharing the flat and one of the guys was a real psycho.

One evening we (me and said girl) were out at one of her friends for the evening drinking and getting stoned after a night shift (we also worked together in a casino).

When it got to time to leave she decided she would stay the night on her friends futon to avoid dealing with Mr psycho, I was invited to share it with her.

Its working pretty well: I've made it clear to them that I am in no way ready for a commitment and they've each acknowledged that.

t3_2lurs1,"Hello, all. I just recently got out of a long term relationship of 5 years. My ex and I used to attend the same university, but I got into med school and since moved away. The distance was rough on us, and it led to a lot of changes on my end. In the end, we decided to end it and did so amicably. When we first broke up, I asked that we remain friends and still update one another one each other's lives. At first, I thought that I could easily fall back into being friends with him, but I realized that it was too painful to talk to him or text him and be reminded of the end of the relationship. 

A few days after the break up, he called me, and I didn't pick up because I knew it would be too painful to speak to him. I sent him an email explaining that I wanted no contact for a little while so that we could both heal from the break up. I did have nothing from him for a day or so, but this morning I woke up and saw a text from him wishing me luck for an upcoming test. Seeing the text made me sad and a little upset that he is unwilling to respect the no-contact rule that I requested.

I think that he continues to reach out to me because he doesn't have as good of a support group as I do (family and friends who support me and check in on me periodically), and for the past 5 years, I was that support. So, he is reaching out to me, but I don't think that reaching out to me will help either of us heal.

Halloween roles around and we are going to a party together. I find a good moment where we are alone to ask her if she wanted to go steady.

t3_2mk5y9,"Maybe five or six weeks ago, I was sitting with my boyfriend as he was on his phone. I can't remember why, but at one point he went to his texts and gave it a big scroll back (I didn't see how far). As it came to a stop, a text from ""Diane"" saying ""Fo sho"" caught my eye. I don't know that name, but I didn't really think anything of it, as my boyfriend works freelance and talks to a lot of people, most of whose names I don't know.

Over the next few weeks, I found myself occasionally wondering who Diane was. I didn't want to make my boyfriend feel accused, and I trust him, but after a while I figured what's the harm in asking. I'll ask, he'll tell me she's one of his students' moms or something, and all will be fine.

So last night after dinner, we were hanging out and I said as casually and not accusing a way as possible, ""hey, I know this is silly and I'm sorry for worrying about something so meaningless, but can you tell me who Diane is? I saw a text from someone by that name while you were on your phone a few weeks ago.""

He had no idea what I was talking about. Doesn't know any Diane. He pulled out his phone, went to his texts, and searched for ""Diane"" and the words ""fo sho."" Zero results. He scrolled back to almost a year, no Diane. He said he was sorry he didn't have an answer but that he hasn't deleted any of his texts. He took me in his arms and promised me he has never lied to me.

So I guess either he's lying, or I didn't see that text, right? I'm sort of desperate for a third possibility. We've had a wonderful relationship, I have no reason to suspect him of anything.

t3_2mqgek,"So this happened a few years ago in grade 12 English class. We were having a discussion about bias, and the teacher asked for an example.
  
About 50 years ago there was a black community not far from where I lived which was demolished by the government for them to build a big bridge over a harbour. The city said that the residents were compensated by being given homes of the same or  better quality despite the fact that they actually gave them really trashy places, carrying them and their belongings in garbage trucks. When the residents complained, they weren't taken seriously in the media because they were black. We learned a lot about it in Elementary School, and it was the first example of media bias I thought of.

So people stick up their hands, and several people give a two or three word answer. I didn't want to be that guy who gives a much longer answer than is needed. When I was called on, I tried to express my example in the least amount of words I could, but it ended up something to the effect of:

""Black people not being as credible as white people.""

It did not occur to me that I should have specified that I meant ""Residents of ______ not being considered as credible as white people in the 60's due to prevalent racism"" , especially considering that I was white and roughly half of the class was black. The room got really quiet and the teacher stared at me for a few seconds.

Also, im irritable on top of the depression so im constantly lashing out verbally. Im trying to see a psychologist but my insurance doesnt cover it so I have to pay a huge chunk of money every visit. I cant afford it right now. 

Throughout this depression Ive had moments of semi-happiness. So when I have those moments and im still not interested in anything or intimate, she takes it as im losing interest in her, Which I AM NOT. I love her dearly.

I can see her slowly becoming mentally drained. I want her in my life, and ive told her that it will pass, which she knows, but her insecurities are getting the best of her.

When I walked over to the dogs and the squirrel, the dogs didn't move, so I had to yell at them to get away.  I am standing in a stranger's yard yelling ""Bad dogs! No! Get out of here!""

After the dogs ran off, I walked back to my car, just as it started to rain.  As soon as I reached my car, one of the dogs ran back over and shook the squirrel to send it flying.  I ran back over to yell some more.  By this point, the neighbors have come out side to stare at me.  I am getting drenched in my business clothes as I yell at the little bitch dog.

The dog ran off again, and as it did, the neighbors (not the ones who owned the dogs… They were never seen) asked what I was doing.  I told them that I was a huge animal lover and can't stand to see an animal in pain.  I then told them that I would be back with a net to relocate the injured squirrel to a new location, away from the little terrors.

About a month later my ex (Steve) from less than an hour away just dumped his ex and we entered a sort of FWB situation. We had been there before because we have excellent sexual chemistry, but the romance wasn't there for YEARS. Now, after a month, the first ex (Bart) and I exchanged letters and we agreed to a friendship, he started going to the gym with me and it was a really good. We both achieved long-sought goals of physical fitness and he was a good motivator. The past two weeks he's been getting cozier. Four days ago he came over and we finally kissed again and we had a loooong talk. I explained that telling somebody you don't love them, and wont have sex with them, isn't a real relationship. He had many many emotional outbursts in the past, which I explained were totally unacceptable. 

Then he pulled what feels like a high school girl move and opened up about a dark secret (long story is he was taken advantage of by a Sugar Daddy who helped pay for college expenses and it had repercussions that manifested as intimacy issues). I told him I didn't really give a shit about it. I also told him that I'd be open to another attempt at a relationship but I wont call him my boyfriend or partner until ""It damn well feels like it"". Maybe that wasn't fair of me. 

So here I am, between two boys. The FWB (Steve) needs to be made aware because we established an exclusive sexual relationship for health reasons.

She went out for a Christmas party with work colleagues and as usual involved dinner and drinks/clubbing. At the end of the night she and her senior (A), who has a higher position, married with children, offered to walk her home. She agreed as she was a bit drunk at this point.

Previous to this she has talked about A as a mentor who has guided her through the new job an given her some good career guidance. Needless to say she trusted him as a friend.

Anyway, once they were at her home he started making very aggressive advances including trying to remove her dress, kissing her & inappropriate touching. All the while she was saying 'Stop, this isn't right, you have a wife' etc. She made it quite clear about this. He continued and at one point he had removed his pants and was trying to get her to perform oral sex on him. Again she refused and he left shortly after. 

She is extremely upset about this and doesn't want to report it to HR or the police as she doesn't want to relive it and would rather forget about it and try to move on, she believes this will give her closure. I can completely understand but to me the situation is much worse then she is giving off and this needs to be reported to their HR department at the very least.

Since the night occurred she has only told a couple of friends (who do not know A) and me. One friend has told her not to do anything about it and says things like this happens, to me this is completely the wrong thing to say and trivialises the situation.

I had never seen a man naked, had never intimately touched a man, or been touched like that myself!  I thought that I would be found out after the deed, but he thinks that I am great in bed!! (Thanks r/sex for the great guides and advice)

We have been close friends for over a year and during that time I lied to him about past boyfriends by saying that my longest relationship was 18 months (it was 3 months) and by telling him that I lived with someone for 6 months (I have never shared my home with anyone).
I also told him that I have been with 6 people, because I was so very ashamed to be a virgin at my age. My family and friends have never found out. I have only admitted it to a therapist once and I broke down in tears as I said it. I was humiliated.

I did not know at the time that I would become so close to him and that I would lose my virginity to him. The lies have become so deep that it has become incredibly difficult to tell him the truth.

What should I do? 

I can see myself with him long term. Perhaps even longer. I can keep this to myself, as I can tell him that I do not want to talk about past relationships but I feel afraid that if he ever found out he would be devastated.

I truly think that I am psychologically unable to confess the truth. I am so ashamed of what my life has been for the past 20 years. This is my first chance at true happiness and I feel like a normal person. I have never felt this way before.

My boyfriend knows our neighbor's friend because his ex girlfriend slept with her (cheated on him with her, sort of). He's seen her around town and he tried to sleep with her long before we got together. He's made a few comments on her looks in the last few days before the party -- big boobs, big butt, ""she's actually pretty attractive"". This doesn't bother me, but I know I'm not his go-to type. I'm petite, but I bust my ass at the gym doing squats to try and get the booty going for us.

Last night was the party. He was out late working until 1:30 AM or so. I left the party around 11. When he came home I was already in my robe. He's not super social and prefers to stay home and relax with me, but for some reason he expressed the desire to stop by our neighbor's party. This was weird because he doesn't really care about the people at the party and in previous situations had passed on seeing them. He had been standing for four hours solid, hauling his heavy gear, and it was 2AM. He insisted on going anyway, which I was fine with.

This morning she added him on Facebook and he accepted. This made me uncomfortable when I looked at the culmination of things (previous flirting, the comments the week before, and that he went out of his way to talk to her at the party and tell me about it when he got home.

I am a recent college graduate (graduated with zero student debt) who is currently unemployed. I have an unpaid internship lined up with very good prospects that it will turn into a paid position after I complete it, and am actively searching for other part-time work to supplement income in the mean time. I am currently living off of a monthly allowance that my parents send me until I secure a job (covers rent and utilities, but barely any left over). I have about ~$800 in credit card debt due to me being financially stupid.

One thing that bothers me sometimes is that I have been purposefully vague about my past relationships and I don't know if I need to open up to him and tell him everything. We are both quiet, introverted people that don't necessarily share every minute detail, so it hasn't been a big deal. 

I was in an emotionally abusive relationship in the past, and had a couple of short-term relationships after that where I was still emotionally unstable. I did some things I am not proud of (breaking up by no contact with one guy, dated another controlling man and then kissed someone else so we would break up) when I was younger. However, I've matured and learned about healthy relationships. I've been in 1-2 healthy relationships before I met my current boyfriend. Most people who know me now don't know any of this, and I an genuinely happy and fulfilled in my personal and professional life. It's only when I sometimes think back to the past I sort of freeze up inside.

I have tried to see a couple of therapists (one after I ended the abusive relationship, and one a few years after that). But both of them stopped seeing me after a few sessions because I seemed pretty well-adjusted and was capable of dealing with the issues. I got some good advice about accepting myself and having healthy habits (exercise, eating well, sleeping well, etc.) to cope, but otherwise nothing major.

t3_2s3z7s,"I currently live in city A, where my girlfriend is from. My girlfriend is in city B for the next couple of years, currently living in residence for school. This April I'm also moving to city B for school - I have 450 hours (1-3 months) of placement before I can work as a registered nurse. Until I'm finished with that and working, I'll be living on student loans. I'm moving to city B for this as placements often lead to jobs - and city B is the place to be. My girlfriend and I are planning on moving in together with a relatively low budget, however it will work out to be the same as if we were living in dorms. Her parents control her finances so we're fairly limited in what we can afford. Recently, her parents suggested that we allow her brother, who's also moving to city B for school, to move in with us. This would allow us to go from renting a small basement apartment to a decently sized unit. I feel like this won't work out smoothly, though. Her brother is a great guy - very quiet, introverted, and spends most of his time in his room. I fear he may feel left out as the third wheel. They get along great and never fight, however aren't very close. Additionally, I fear that with all three of us having social lives the place may be cramped. I was initially excited as moving in with my girlfriend meant us starting our adult lives together - now with her brother it will feel like we're in dorms again. That being said, it would save money and help out her brother as well. He says he doesn't want to impose, but wouldn't mind it as long as we're okay with it.

t3_2s5b1w,"We have always had a closed relationship, we didn't have any social networks and didn't talk with opposite genders. However, when she moved out to a friends house, she changed. She made social networks behind my back, kept constantly controlling me, going out (she doesn't go to school or work) and kept lying to me. 

The only reason I stayed with her was because I knew a breakup would really hurt me in school, especially during finals. I broke it off after school ended and she tried getting me back for a week until I started talking to her again. Things were fine and then she had to move a thousand miles away to her mothers house.

We decided to stay together long-distance since I graduate college in a year. She has been super nice to me but the past couple days she hasn't been texting me for long periods. I decided to look into it and I found out she has been using a dating website and snapchat to meet guys in her area. 

I made a fake account and started talking to her. She started flirting with me and telling me she doesn't have a boyfriends ect. I am going to call her in the morning, what do I say? I'm so broken crying and drinking my life away since I have no friends. My whole life was dedicated to her and school.

The thing that concerns me the most is that I won't be able to concentrate in school. It's my last year taking some hard engineering courses and I know this will tear me apart.

t3_2skxqx,"I was in a really long-term relationship (12yrs), left him over six months ago. Spent the time since enjoying independence, learning about myself and who I am etc. I'm not ready for another relationship. I like the freedom of being on my own...

A guy has entered my life. I've known of him for years, we've chatted a few times at parties etc, but nothing ever happened. We went away for a week for a work conference thing (we work in the same industry). He asked how things were, and I told him I'm single. We caught up a few times for hours chatting and learning about each other. New years eve (at the conference), we hung out in the same group, and flirted a bit, sitting on each others lap etc. 

The group we hung out with really gelled, so as a group we've gotten together almost every 3-4 days over the last few weeks. Each time, the two of us have flirted in front of them, but little to their knowledge, we've also kissed and I've stayed at his house twice (in two weeks) because it was too late to drive home after the group's social events. Nothing happened beyond kissing and heavy rubbing. 

He's made it obvious he would like to have sex, and I would too, but I feel like I would like to know beforehand what it would mean to him - just a f*** buddy, potential relationship etc. To be honest, I don't know what I want from him anyway, so should I need to ask? Should I go with the flow? I haven't really had a lot of experience with dating, so I'm new to all of this. 

We've tentatively discussed going away for the weekend hiking one weekend. So there's future discussions there, but I know that doesn't mean anything. Friends go hiking!

He always wants to cuddle, cooks for me, surprises me with gifts, and just other nice things. When I'm with him I feel like the only person in the world to him (lame I know).   
  
Sex now has been dwindling. And now it's four times a month, or three times a month. This month it has only been once and the month is almost over. I feel bad for counting but I this is something that I have been deprived of for almost a year. We have talked about it a few times on why his sex drive is down. He now has a stressful job with is very understaffed. I understand that but he masturbates so much. Now, I know it is much easier just to have wank than to have sex. I'm guilty of it, you the reader probably is to. I've tried many things to try and initiate sex, sexy outfits, new sexy underwear, some role play. I'm tired of masturbating and I'm now so irritable.

I'm pretty introverted, so he was my only friend, and he held a grudge. So here I am, introverted and alone in a STEM school which is guy-dominant, and I don't know how to interact with them. I really think it would be good for me to get out there again, but I've never been good at making friends, let alone the whole dating scene.

I joined a few clubs at the beginning of last semester, and met a group of three guy friends[all 20/M] who live together, and do everything together. I feel comfortable enough around them now, but still get nervous even asking them to hang out, because I get paranoid that I'm a nuisance. I want to become closer friends with all of them, but don't know how to go about doing that.

In particular, one of them I can't help being drawn to. He's extremely passionate, and talented, and just amazing to talk to, and he and I are a lot alike. He's not the kind of guy I usually go for, and I'm not sure what it is about him that makes him stick in my mind so much, but I can't help thinking about him.

There's something about myself I developed during this relationship that I don't like and I think it's unhealthy. It's hard to explain but I became very attached to this person, so much so that I would get very anxious when they were away from me. It made me uneasy when ever she was out or away. I kept thinking she would meet someone else. I felt as though she is wasn't really interested in me, and I would do things to make her jealous. 

I had really high self esteem going into the relationship, but it got lower and lower during my time with her. It felt as though she always kept me at an arms length, saying she has to maintain her independence. She kept secrets, and didn't really communicate to me. She would flirt with other guys. When I told her my feelings that I don't appreciate that, she said that she can do what ever she wants that she's a grown woman. 

It's confusing me because with my ex-ex-gf, it was different. I loved when she would go away and I had time to myself. I missed her still, but it wasn't crippling and playing on my mind all the time. I could still relax and look forward to having her come home. 

Can anyone identify what is going on here? I don't want this to carry on into future relationships. Any more info needed or questions I'll be  sure to answer!

t3_2u87ts,"Okay I know this is going to be one of the dumbest questions you have probably ever come across but I am kind of at a loss here because this is a first for me.

A girl I have just started to see, I'll call her Amanda, has been really nice.  She is pretty, funny and somewhat nerdy (which I find attractive) and we have had fun on the couple of dates we have been on.  Now I am a slow mover to begin with so there has been no advancement by me (or her) for any type of physical relationship yet, this is fine with me I kind of like to get to know a person first.

But due to a quirk of fate I found out we have  a mutual friend, female, and she told me that she was shocked that Amanda was going out with me because the last she new she was gay.  At first I thought she was kidding but she was dead serious.

Now I'm kind of stressing about things because I don't know the real story here.

Are we just friends and she is hanging out with me as a friend?  If she is interested in me romantically where can this go?  I am deathly afraid of falling for her and spending 3-4 years of my life only for her to wake up one day and decide that she really misses women?  

I know that last one is probably not logical but that is where my brain is.

Do I ask her about this?  Is that rude?  Is it any of my business?  Will she be offended or think less of me if I ask?

If I don't ask do I just go on forever pretending like I don't know?

There are a thousand other questions I want to ask but that is a pretty irrational start.

t3_2ud7ve,"So I have liked this girl for the past year or so. We've been nothing but friends so far & only talk online (we met once in passing but at the start of the friendship). She currently is in a long distance relationship of 6 months with a guy a few years older than me. I completely respect that fact & I would not want her (or anyone) to break up their relationship for me. 

However, she opened up to me the other day about how she's having problems & they argue a lot. I gave her some friendly advice about what to do. She then started to sort things out with the issues they are having. 

This was fine with me, I'm glad she's sorted it out but I get very mixed signals from her. We have pretty deep conversations. The other day we were talking about how well we get along and our preferences in the opposite and we both sorta match each others' criteria. She also complained how nobody has taken her on a proper date before & how she's been messed about in relationships in the past...However, she will suddenly stop replying part way through conversations then either reply the next day or not at all. I'm finding it rather confusing.  

We decided we would hang out properly for the first time tomorrow. I really don't know how to take this or what I should do. I was thinking of going for a drive & then head back to mine for some dinner but I don't want to act weird around her.

t3_2ue9qh,"I know people in this sub tend to look down on teenage drama but this has been bugging me recently.

My old SO, we can call her Jane, were in a relationship for a significant length of time during middle school. Post relationship, I maintained a sort of ""gay best friend"" friendship with her; a very very close platonic partnership. Jane was supportive me of in my quest for love through high school, and I tried to help her out as well, but she has yet to have any luck whatsoever.

Recently I started dating a third girl, who we will call Jill. Jill is in the same small friend group as Jane is, and I gained interest in Jill at the beginning of this year of high school. Jane was supportive of me, but she had big doubts about my chances will Jill, until it slipped out that Jill knew I fancied her and wouldn't mind a date. Even though I have seen images of these conversations, Jane has been telling me that Jill doesn't want to date, which I know is false because we began chatting up and are prepared to do an official first date soon.

As soon as news of this broke, Jane began to be more hostile to me that usual. We went from chatting every day for a few hours to twice in the last 2 weeks. She also insults me more (this is significant because although we maintained a very sarcastic attitude with each other, she has begun to cross a line and be mean). Jane is stonewalling my efforts here; it is unfair of her to intrude on this new relationship of mine. However, I don't know how to deal with this, because Jane is possibly my best friend but still is being a big nuisance.

I don't know what to do here; I don't think I have to pick between Jane and Jill but it seems that I have to make that choice. Can someone explain what is happening?

Fearing long distance, my SO applied for non-research post here in the UK and has gotten an interview. I am fairly certain he'll get the job and then he'll want to move back.

t3_2vxyh8,"Throwaway since he knows my username.

So my friend (let's call him Jake) left for college a few months ago. Jake has been my best friend for the last couple of years, and I took it pretty hard when he had to leave. He promised to visit every so often, and we still texted/ facebook messaged quite often. We cared a lot about each other; we helped each other with our problems and he was just a lot of fun to be around. 

However, maybe two or three months after he left, Jake got a girlfriend. 

She seemed really awesome and since this was his first girlfriend, Jake was over the moon. He told me everything about her. And I honestly could not have been happier for him. 

It started getting a little frustrating when Jake would visit, as he would be texting his girlfriend the **entire time.**

Not even exaggerating. I would be talking to him, and he would just nod his head and stare at his phone. 

I didn't want to bug him about it; I knew that he was happy about having a girlfriend and they seemed really good together. But slowly, the facebook conversations stopped. He didn't visit anymore. And every single time I tried to talk to Jake, he was with his girlfriend. 

The last conversation I had with him, I asked if he didn't like talking to me anymore, or if he was tired of me. He said no, but we haven't talked since. 

I did see him one more time after that over Christmas break at a game night a bunch of my friends were at, but he brought his girlfriend with him and he didn't even look at me. 

Since the majority of my friends have left for college, I've been incredibly lonely. Losing my best friend has just made everything worse, and I can't think about him without getting super upset. As far as I know, it wasn't anything I did that made him stop talking to me, but I can't help but feel that it's my fault.

About six days ago I went for a really hefty workout (martial arts) for about 1.5 hours. After that I felt pretty good, and the next morning I was really sore (pretty usual stuff).

Anyone know what is causing this? Is it possible I have some kind of head cold or something? Seeing a doctor isn't a problem, I just want to know for sure it's what I should do before taking time off work. It's not terribly uncomfortable but it's not getting better...

She knows me and that we're in a relationship, but I don't know if she necessarily respects that. While this wouldn't have bothered me if it were one of his long-time friends who sent it, she isn't super close with him. She also has had a history of (in my opinion) acting flirtatious with him and crossing some lines with her behavior, and a couple times, being really disrespectful toward me when I saw her in person. I get the impression that she's sneaky and manipulative - I think she has an agenda - but my boyfriend disagrees and thinks she's innocent and just trying to be friends.

In any case, a while back, I got pretty uncomfortable with her behavior, so I asked him to set some firmer boundaries with her. He did, and he actually ended up going a step further and distancing himself from her as a friend. They only talk every now and then, and she's not happy about that - she tries to contact him a lot, and posts a lot of passive aggressive posts on social media.

Throwaway on the off chance she goes to reddit, goes to this particular sub and see this specific post...

The Turn:

So we've been together for almost four years now. Awesome relationship, insanely close all those good things. A couple of  rough patches but we persevere. Girlfriend, who was living with her friends, had to move home because of a teaching internship she received, no pay only stipends towards her grad school.  

The Pledge:

So last June my lease was up and I wanted to move out of into a better area without my college friends. My girlfriend is ecstatic, we talk about moving in together.

 Awesome possum, we find a nice place close central to both of our jobs.  She lets me know she won't be able to pay her full share of the rent due to aforementioned internship. Ain't no thang. I can front the bills and she can chip in what she can. We both sign the lease.

Lease starts in September, due to school and shit, her move in date is December, I'm cool with it cause well I am. Well December turned into a January move in...which turned into a February move in...which turned into a beginning of March...which turned into end of March.

The Prestige:

So I just got off the phone with her about an hour ago and the topic of her move in came up because I need to request time off from work to help (retail manager :0 ). Well she doesn't think she can do March now. What the actual hell.

My FH and I are both military (LDR for 4 years) and stationed at different bases.  We have been talking marriage for over a year, planning on doing a simple backyard ceremony within the next year or two.  Fast forward to recent times, and he has gotten overseas orders, leaving in fall of this year.  I am unable to go with him unless we are married.  

To top it all off, I was recently deployed for 6 months, and at the end of my deployment, my FH deployed to a different area.  By the time he gets back (late spring) it will have been a year since we've seen each other. 

Anyway, after discussion, we have decided to get married before he goes overseas.  Then, either I can try to apply to get orders with him, or I will be eligible to go be with him after my contract is up next year. 

He is coming to visit me after he gets back from his deployment, and we have been discussing doing a court house marriage at that time.  The problem with this, is that both of our families would not be able to make it at that time (both his dad and my grandma are dealing with serious illnesses at this time).  We do not want to disappoint our families by getting married without them, but we absolutely cannot wait on the marriage due to the military.

He supposedly has been like this with many other people, but only to me in our current friends circle.

I, on the hand, think I have put a lot of effort in being nice back to him despite everything.

I thought that our friendship was improving a lot, however recently he acted in a way that I found very insulting. I felt as though he had not respected me as a person and, to an extent, used me. To be honest, I am now unsure of whether he ever valued me as a friend like I thought of him. 

This friendship has a taken a lot out of me over a long time, and now I am uncertain whether I should just give up and kick him out of my life or try to mend it and keep going.

Now, one thing I haven't mentioned yet is that I am a dialysis patient. I got a rare autoimmune disease when I was 19 and almost died. I had to drop out of university and move back across the country to live with my parents. Lots of crazy shit has happened since then, and I will be on dialysis for the rest of my life.

They do bloodwork, you meet with a dietician, you meet with a pharmacist, they check blood pressures and things, and you meet with a doctor. Takes about three hours. 

My bloodwork has traditionally been shitty. My phosphorus, calcium, potassium levels have been all over the place. I was on 10 pills a day to manage my calcium alone.

I've been taken off more than 50% of my medications because I don't need them anymore.

Now, his reason for wanting to leave was personal. It was to find another job and build dependency because he felt really uneasy being where he was at. He pretty much isn't happy with where his current living condition is and wants to make a change in life.

She went as far as pulling the race card, telling him that ""Mexican girls are lazy, and cling to a good man whenever they can""

She wanted to be friends but yeah, she'd get angry and block me if I went on a date with someone and she found out. It left me in a very weird situation because I like my ex, she's a nice person and I'd prefer her to be in my life rather than completely gone.

few months ago she went out with another guy which is fine but I'm not sure why, the guy she went out with was everything she hated in a guy and I felt like she did it to kind of wind me up by letting me know what they're up to etc.

BACKSTORY: I had dated this girl freshman year of Highschool. Things were good, but I broke up with her out of peer pressure. I was a self conscious Freshman with little self esteem. I regretted it for years, and the fact we ended up being FWB a couple times did not help. 

So we both get through our first semester of college, myself at a school in Tx, her in Ok. Didn't see each other often, but we did snapchat back and forth once and a while. Well over break she says she is tired of being single, her ex was shitty, blah blah blah. I offer to take her out.

We both dress up, and I took her to this little seafood restaurant, and go see a movie after. The movie I wanted to see so that wasn't really a problem. But I paid for all of it. Every dime.

Throughout the course of the evening all the repressed feelings I had resurfaced, we kissed, it was a bomb time.

t3_2zm1b5,"So winter has seemingly been coming to an end where I live and yesterday was probably the nicest day of the year so far.  It was one of my friend's birthdays so we gathered at his house and cracked a few beers.  All was going well so we decided to move the small celebration to the front porch considering the refreshing warm weather.

The streets were fairly bustling in the college neighborhood and people in general just seemed grateful to be experiencing spring.  Cars were coming and going, women were rollerblading and men were long boarding.  What an enjoyable day so far!

It was beginning to get dark out but the temperature was still favorable.  Across the street and in between 2 cars was a curb sewer, kind of like [this] .  I had been looking in that direction for whatever reason when I witnessed the biggest raccoon I have ever seen crawl out of the sewer.  I initially thought it was an average-sized house dog.  It was HUGE compared to any other raccoon I had seen before.

""HOLY SHIT! LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT COON!"" I was so impressed by this thing's presence.  When my friends also spotted it, their reaction was nearly identical.  We were all standing at this point, laughing and pointing toward the sewer, screaming about the size of the damn raccoon.

The car that was parked right behind the sewer turned on.  It took us by surprise as I guess we weren't expecting anybody to be in it for whatever reason, probably because we were intoxicated and didn't notice it when it originally arrived.

The driver, who never saw the raccoon, rolled his window down as he passed the porch to reveal himself.  He was a large black man with his middle finger up, screaming ""FUCK YOU, YOU RACIST MOTHERFUCKERS!"".

This one lady I know for a fact lives there and I see her every afternoon sitting there when I pull in after work, and still sitting there a half hour later after I take a shower.  The building faces the ocean, but these people choose to back into the parking spot so they are facing the building, middle of winter so it's cold as balls outside, and just sit there.  Doing who the hell knows what.  It's so weird.

Anyway one morning I wake up and my roommates rockin a piss already.  It's one of those mornings where I simply could not wait 30 seconds for him to finish, I had to piss *now*.  I did the only logical thing and swung open the sliding door to the deck (that faces the parking lot/ocean) and do my business in the warm doorway, giving that dirty deck a nice golden shower. 

This happened at 6:15 am.  Before I pissed everywhere I was careful to check out the lot.  Every single car was off.  There was no wind; it was silent. I was sure no cars were running.  I scanned each car individually and they all appeared totally empty.  Perfect, open the flood gates.

But as fate would have it, on the one god damn morning I decide to piss out the deck door, halfway through my business some lone motherfucker just swings his car door open and hops out like it's nothing out of the ordinary to sit in his car at 6:15am doing literally nothing.  I had my pants pulled down just enough to reveal just my dick; I don't even care if he saw it.  I cared more about cutting off the flow and not dribbling all over the inside rug for fuck's sakes.

Turns out that in the state of NY, I dont live there and I have obonly been there like 2 times prior, that driving while holding an electronic device of any type is illegal.

t3_31t9wy,"For a couple of years now I've had an acquaintance that I really enjoy talking to and ended up developing a big crush on.

We met when we were both married, nothing inappropriate went on. Eventually I found out she got separated and we stopped talking. About a year went by and I ended up getting separated from my wife. After I was separated for a bit I contacted her again and after a little back and forth I asked her out. She then informed me that she was seeing someone else (that really hurt).

Even though she is seeing someone, and it really hurt to be rejected, I still enjoy talking to her. Our conversations have been been limited to email and texting for now. Our conversations are light and simple, some joking around.

I know continuing to talk to her is not the smartest decision, since she is involved, and if she doesn't answer I get paranoid she doesn't want to talk to me. Despite this, I would like to keep some time of communication with her. Is this weird?

t3_31y1u5,"Hi.  First off, I've already made an appointment with a lawyer but I figured as much information as possible couldnt hurt.

In february, I rear-ended a car after skidding on water.  The car accident was pretty minimal honestly (my airbags didn't deploy/car function fine/only cosmetic damage).  A cop was called and took accounts and photos.  The guy seemed irritated but not hurt in the least.  I gave him/the police my insurance and contact information.  As far as I knew he took care of it and I hadn't heard from him.

Apparently, the cop miswrote my cell number (making a 1 look like a 7) and the guy had been trying to contact me.  I found out my insurance policy that had been in effect was cancelled due to lack of payment (I was on my parents insurance and I was unaware they hadn't paid/they did not inform me).  I got my own insurance asap but I found out I was basically boned because I technically didn't have insurance during the time the accident occurred.

This morning I received a manila envelope on my car windshield addressed to me.  In it, the guy wrote me a letter describing his attempts to contact me.  Additionally, he included a large amount of my information he could find online (facebook photos, employee page, white pages info, etc.).  He also included the incident report and two quotes for repairs to his damages.  He's seeking me to pay him in a cash order for the full repair of his car or he will seek more, including damages for ""whiplash and a concussion"" although as far as I can tell he has no proof of either.  Basically, what is my best option here.

Also, while I know he had active insurance, am I responsible for the full amount or for whatever the deductible would be?",P2p07Up4eJyvxrrVYgwtb60krbFbxI,ref," I rear ended a guy, discovered my insurance had expired without my knowledge.

t3_32932f,"I play video games; I have since I was a kid starting with Pokemon red. I still play them everyday, yet I refuse to call myself a gamer.

The way I see it, gaming has become more popular than ever. There are more people playing then ever before and subsequently more self-proclaimed gamers. However, since it has become so main stream, I don't see how it's much different than saying ""I'm a TV watcher"" or ""music listener."" Now if you said you only played tabletop or something, that'd be different.

The truth is that it isn't about being hardcore or even playing games. It's about wanting to be in a nerdy subculture that pretends it's niche when that couldn't be farther from the truth. Playing games is as mainstream as it gets.

No, it's about the culture that I think is frankly ridiculous. It's a bunch of nostalgia circlejerks and pseudo inside jokes for things that are actually quite popular (took an arrow to the knee, etc.) It doesn't matter if the latest call of duty (for example) is good or not, what matters is whether it's popular with ""gamers.""

""CoD is the same every time but the new Pokemon is pretty swell."" 

This hypocrisy and favoritism makes my blood boil. I've never played call of duty because it's not my cup of tea, not because ""that's what casuals play."" The whole PC master race also irritates me. Who really gives a shit what someones console preference is?

The kids father happens to have a few children with various women. His family member adopted one of the kids he has (my friends kid.) as part of the agreement she signed away all rights at the age of 16 in order to never pay child support. She has since kept in contact with him and continues to be a part of his life.

Fast forward to today. The ""dad"" got sued for child support from another woman. He has a hefty fine to pay monthly. Now his family member who had adopted their kid wants to abandon the adoption and force the guardianship to default to the parents. My friend was pretty excited about this and wants to care for the kid, but now the ""dad"" says the kid might not want to live with her part time and that she should pay him child support (he's brought it up several times about how she should pay him child support since he's been sued.)

Also another weird thing was that he wanted to live with her. (It's pretty obvious he's had a thing for her the past 5 years since they broke up.) She's in a happy relationship and really doesn't want much to do with him. (After this he again brought up the child support.)

The lawyer she saw says there isn't much she can do because the guardianship is going to go to her and she'll have to help support the kid.

So I've been in love (and dating) this girl for awhile now. She's really similar to me (my friends call her the female version of me). We both really like video games, drawing, programming, sex, and more.

I'm not sure if this is normal or if I'm doing something overly wrong.

I figured I would ask reddit. (Also if the shoe throwing thing seems mild, the other night she got pissed at me for leaving milk on the counter and almost stabbed me with a kitchen knife. Two minutes later she whispered she wanted my babies (in front of my roomate)).

So, the title pretty much summarizes the situation. My dad has gone to is home country to work on his family business. This is the most time my parents have been apart since they met (around 1997, married since 1999). my mom has been talking more and more to her second in command ""Jack"". Her job is very high stress (humanitarian organization) and she must deal with emergencies as they arise, thus the increased contact. 

Another thing worth mentioning is that my mom has been getting home relatively late, for about 2 weeks now. She says she has dinners that she must attend to. Whenever she talks to Jack (by phone), she walks away to somewhere out of earshot. The event that began my suspicions (around 2 months ago) was when i was in her office after school, and Jack came in. He was about to say something but he realized I was there. He asked if he could talk to her in private, so they left to another part of the building. She told me it would take 10 minutes. She came back an hour and a half later. Yesterday she got a call from him as we arrived home from doing errands. Again, she walked to a secluded area of our condominium and they talked for 20 minutes. I guess this entire thing is based on assumptions.

At the time I was madly in love with her and was not confident enough to think I would be able to be with anyone who was as attractive or compatible.  During that period of the two break ups she cheated on me and told me about it years later because of guilt.  

Fast forward to now, I have definitely evolved as a person.  I am more confident and it has captured the attention of a lot of attractive girls.  Every time I go out with my friends and get the attention of a girl, I think to myself, ""maybe I'm entitled to this.""  Of course, I respect my girlfriend too much to act on those desires.  

Yesterday I tried breaking up with her by bringing up some excuse about a potential possibility of a long distance relationship.  The conversation we had made me think about how long we've been together, how much I really like her, how committed she's been since then and how special what we have is.

2 months ago I caught my girlfriend sending text messages to a 'friend' from church. It wasn't the fact that she was texting a man it was what they were talking about. One message from the other read something like 'i hope we can be in a relationship in the future'. Even after this she still continued to talk to him. Once I saw the message I confronted her about it and she acted naive and said she would end it.  
  
Fast forward to last night. After a date at a concert and a couple beers she receded to the bedroom. As I was not ready for bed I walked into the bedroom to grab my charger and a night shirt. I found her shirt up and pants down. I asked her what was going on and she replied that she was just taking a picture. I brushed it off and went back to what I was doing.  
2 hours later I climbed in bed and noticed her phone was still playing music. I reached over to turn it off and noticed that her indicator light was flashing yellow and she had a snapchat. By this point I was concerned that the picture taking was related so I opened snapchat to a single message 'wow I was not expecting that'.  
Curious as to who this guy was, and I admit at this point I am in the wrong, I searched her messages for the user name. It came back from a Facebook message from a guy who is friends with my sister and they had met at my sister's wedding 9 months ago.

t3_37wfyw,"Some preliminary notes — this happened yesterday at school, and it was actually my friend who caused this whole ordeal (his bottle, his attempt to clean it). Regardless, I'll share my bland point of view since I was in attendance the entire time.

In the morning announcements, we were all instructed to empty out our lockers by the end of the day or risk losing whatever we failed to reclaim. Two friends and I — one friend, Zed (not his real name), being the character of importance — shared a locker, and the only remaining articles were our history textbooks and Zed's running shoes and opaque water bottle. Zed had told me throughout the year not to touch his bottle because it's ""a bomb"", and I never thought much of it until that day.

During our break between second and third period, the three of us returned our textbooks and went with Zed to the bathroom, who intended to wash his bottle. He unscrewed the top and dumped the contents into one of the toilets — some pale orange liquid that, to me, faintly resembled vomit. He then proceeded to the nearest sink and left the now-empty bottle under some running water. At this point in time, there was nothing in the bathroom that smelled particularly bad.

Almost instantaneously, the air was pervaded by the most putrid stench conceivable, and, by split-second deduction, we pinpoint the cause to be whatever he poured out into the toilet. Half the people in the bathroom start coughing and grunting after mere seconds, many already trying to push past me and run out. I grabbed my friends and stumbled backwards with them out into the hallway, which was already completely obstructed by people who had retreated or were reluctant to enter (the odor had already seeped well out the doorway).

Soon enough, you had a whole nauseated crowd lingering outside the bathroom, with no one besides us really knowing what was discharging that terrible redolence. I stood on the side laughing for a good ten minutes while the crowd (but not the stink) gradually thinned out, while Zed tried to save any familiar-looking soul that intended to enter the abyss.",7rETShtxBTLBtbJKVyfpUYUNJjQAOC,sup4_6b_ppo_rm4_6b_t.7," Friend poured something into his water bottle and left it under running water in a school bathroom, causing a terrible stench that pervaded the school and caused many to vomit.",5.0

I received lots of advice to not make a major life decision while I was depressed, so we stayed together.

On the other hand, it wasn't merely infatuation on her part, because he knew her feelings and reciprocated somehow. I gathered all this from what she told me, because I have no independent evidence to go on.

Anyway, her latest contact with this character was an (innocuous) email exchange just after she quit the job (which was temporary), in which she asked if he could provide a reference for future job applications, and he agreed.

After this, she confessed to me about this thing and insisted that it was all in the past. She agreed not to contact him again and not to reply if he contacted her, which (apparently) he hasn't.

The problem is that she is now thinking of applying for her next temporary job and has already updated her CV with details of her last employer, naming this guy as a referee.  I'm not exactly happy about this because it could provide an excuse for him to contact her. Even if he doesn't contact her, writing a reference effectively gives him some kind of power to be helpful to her. (I know because I often write references for people at work.) This is a sensitive topic because apparently the main reason she fell for him is that he was soooo helpful at work.

My wife doesn't see this as a problem because the agent or new employer (not she) would be contacting him for a reference, and she thinks it would look strange/suspicious if she omitted this detail from her job application.

t3_393nsz,"anyway, here goes. Over the past few months, and with increasing regularity, I've been receiving prank calls on my cell phone. Always from a different number, and from area codes all over the U.S., but every call comes from some smart-ass adult, saying they were from some Automotive group, or something of the sort. At first they sounded completely legit, but then they'd ask to speak with Bob. Since I'm not Bob, I'd tell them there's no one here named Bob, you have the wrong number. They would repeat my number back to me, and say they wanted to speak to Bob Zurncle. (Bob's Your Uncle, just in case you missed it) Needless to say, this has become increasingly annoying, especially since the caller is going through a lot of trouble, spoofing fake area codes, and always using this horribly stereotypical fake Hindi accent. Today I received another one of these calls and I'd had enough. I answered, and right away they asked for Bob's Ur Uncle, and I snapped, started cussing a streak, yelling, asking why they didn't have anything better to do with their life, when I hear a woman on the line, saying please sir, let me explain.

So me and my girlfriend (If you can call it that) have been going out for a month now, but I was somewhat uncertain about me feelings for her. 

So there came a day when she called for a talk (Friday) and here I tried to express my true feelings about not being too sure, so then we left it at that and a few days. I was pretty down because of the pain I caused her. She asked if I was okay but I sort of brushed it off while feeling down. I was out of character, and many people realized how I was. (Its really hard to bring yourself up, any advice to cope)

Fast forward to Monday, we have a brief exchange of returning her belongings, and the following day we spoke. She said she was hurt and even more so about the fact I never tried to contact her, and it appeared to her that she did not mean much to me, which is quite the opposite. This day (Tuesday) we were talking to each other for a few hours, but most of it was like our regular banter talking about random stuff like it was sort of normal. Towards the end, we went back into business and she said she was willing to see how this went through since she didn't know how much she liked me. Day ended, texts were a little out of character. 

Wednesday, nothing much really happened, texts here and there. She was busy and I wanted to talk to her. In the end, I told her I would be there for her even if things did not work out. She said she didn't want to lose a friend over this, and also stated it would take a while to actually forgive me. Then we went into somewhat friendly banter and end of day.

He and I explored our sexuality together and we had an INCREDIBLE sex life full of kinks and orgasms and everything I could ever want.

But now I can't get turned on by him unless I'm drinking and already turned on to an extent. If he tries to initiate it all feels wrong. I can't stop comparing him to my friend. I can be in the mood and my husband will kiss me and there's just nothing there, or worse, I get disgusted. My husband is aware of my feelings and lack of drive toward him and is being very patient with everything.

I don't want to feel this way anymore, I want my intimacy and my sex life back and don't have any idea how to make that happen.

t3_3bfziy,"I'm going to start off by saying that this actually happened a few weeks ago, but I never thought to post it in here.

I have a friend that lives in another country to me and let's just say that we aren't exactly shy with each other. Now, with that said, we do have Skype sex (if that's what you call it). This guy *knows* how to get me off and how to finish me by telling me to do the right things. 

I knew that I could squirt before I met this person, but damn, I never knew how much. To be as blunt as possible, he told me what fingers to use that could get me to squirt more. So there I was, lying on my bed with my laptop in front of me whilst I was at it, and once I began squirting I seriously could not control the direction of it. At the time I didn't care. It was fucking good. 

It was afterwards that I noticed my fuck up. My laptop screen and whole keyboard was literally soaked. It looked like I spilt a cup of water over it. Instantly I knew it was broken. I cleaned it up so fast but keys began typing letters without being clicked and my screen was going crazy. When I did type, the wrong symbols would appear in relation to what keys I pressed. My friend told me to leave it to dry and it might work but found it hilarious overall. Next time I turned it on, a super loud beeping noise came out of my speakers during the start up screen. Still does this every so often as well.

Week after, I did it again on my phone screen (you would have thought I learnt my lesson) and now my charging port/sometimes my volume is fucked.

t3_3bpwqh,"Hey reddit, obvious throwaway just to be safe. This is an odd situation with me.

Earlier today I was at work having lunch, when Kate decides to tell me and another co-worker a secret of hers. It went something like ""2 years ago, Adam that used to work here engaged in sexual activies"" - she knew I was friends with Adam, she did not know that he lives with me however. 

Now, normally I would confront him about it, ask him wtf he is doing, he's my best mate - but he tends to not always think with his head. The problem lies with the fact his girlfriend is also a very good friend of mine, and so if I confront the issue between them, im walking away without a friend. 

I know he's better than this, but I am extremely upset. Furthermore, if it was something that happened 2 years ago, I would accept he fucked up and moved on, but Kate decides to tell me that he contacted her this spring. Which means, once a cheater always a cheater. His excuse for it was pathetic, Kate knew she fucked up and declined any more efforts of his.

So reddit, what should I do? Part of me is inclined to erase this from my memory, it's none of my business, it's between Adam, Kate, and Adam's GF. On the other hand, Adam's gf is crazy about him, wants to marry him, and seeing her waste her life away on this guy is heartbreaking. If I told her, I am scared of what he might to do - he lives with me and it will get ugly, as he has anger issues  (albeit, not as bad as they used to be) and tends to act on impulse rather than with his head.

 ""Hey, I don't really get X line. It doesn't make much sense because it implies Y when I know you're actually trying to say Z""

So instead of her taking the feedback, think about it for a second, or argue why she wrote that way. She freaked out, and said that I was wrong. How is it even possible that I understood that line like that, etc... 

At another time, she cooked something and she put too much salt on the food. She asked ""How is it?"" and I told her ""I really liked X and Y, but I think Z is a bit salty for my taste""

t3_3c65v7,"Some quick details. I have known her for 2 years now, been good friends for one year, and we both started talking a lot and liking each other within the past 2-3 months. I'm still in high school (senior next year) and she is starting college next year. She moves into her place which is an hour away in 2 weeks and is also leaving to Europe for 2 weeks the same week. I basically have 3 weeks of summer with her and 2 of them consist of her living an hour away.

I like her a lot. She is the best match I have ever found. We are alike in all the right ways and yet are different enough to stay interested. She likes me, not quite as much honestly, but as much as I would expect from 2 months of frequent talking.

Now the issue. She is going to live an hour away. Now a few problems arise. 1. Transportation. Well I can drive and so can she. My parents are kind enough to where if I say that we're dating they'd pay for the gas for me to see her like once a week. 2. It feels wrong, like I'm holding her back from fully experiencing life and the newfound freedom that she has. I talked to her about it and she said it felt the same for her, like it would be holding me back from experiences I could have, with me being stuck on her. And 3. The reality of a long distance relationship, even if its only an hour long. We are both realists when it comes to life. We see what we think the most likely outcome would be.

(I don't want to put the burden of life onto someone else either!) I discussed it with my friends and came down to ""enjoy your time here while you can"", so I decided I'd focus on the things I love, which are videogames and sex.

 With my GF and I going to seperate colleges in a month, I figured that this would be the end and I would be able to finally get my sex life going and have some fun. (We will be 12hrs apart by car)

 So now that I'm overseas I thought I'd visit an erotic massage place and enjoy myself. I recieved unprotected fellatio for 20seconds before I suggested that she wrap it up. We then had protected intercourse. 

 It was not very enjoyable. It made me realize sex is not just about pleasing yourself or your partner but its about the special connection you share. I really regret not rubbing one out before I left that day.

 When I got home that night I realized I had betrayed my SO's trust and I cried thinking about it. How it would hurt her knowing I did this. I realized how special she is to me. (I'm tearing up as I write this.)

 I sent her a message that night telling her how much she meant to me and I would stay in a long distance relationship so that we could move in together and that I will stay loyal to her for four years. I meant it and I mean it forever, this experienced changed me for the better. I'm out of my existential crisis now, I realized that my purpose is in life is to build a great one with her, together.

I took it on, and because I was so new, I didn't know about or use the time tracking tools Elance has built in to guarantee payment. I know, stupid of me, but so it goes.

So I turned in my invoice and, surprise, I never got paid. Elance said since I hadn't used their time tracking tools, all they could do was give me contact information. I tried and got nothing -- no surprise, since all they had was an email address and a fake phone number. So that was a dead end.

I guess my question is, is there any point in reporting to Fiverr? Are there other legal steps I could take? Or do I just need to move on and eat the losses?

About 2 weeks ago, her attitude changed. After being extremely warm and sweet, she started picking on me. I called her out on it and she immediately ceased communication with me. We had a brief conversation where she said she could only be coworkers and not friends. I gave her a few days to get over it and then asked her if she could let go whatever I did wrong and I apologized, even though I don't know what I did. She told me not to contact her anymore and then the next day reported me for harassment at work. I showed my managers our texts so they know I didn't harass her but they told me not to text her anymore unless it is work related.  

I am pretty crushed by this sudden change. I can't believe someone would try to get me fired when we were so close. I really don't know what I did wrong.

My Dad works nights a lot so he regularly takes the laptop with him, so I just assumed he would visit the sites then.

We've always prided ourselves on not needing a label and being flexible with each other. Especially with it being too long of a distance to be able to see each other often, we both thought it was wisest not to put any pressure to keep something afloat between us.

Having said that, the last time I visited I started thinking ""Why not?"" and have been starting to have major feelings for her. She did too, at least for the first few days after I visited, but like everything long distance, time and distance starts to numb the feelings a bit. 

With my growing affection for this girl, I've noticed myself getting more jealous and insecure about what she's doing all the time. That isn't healthy to begin with, I know, but I find it hard to bring this up in conversation when we have never explicitly mentioned our rule about exclusivity. It would be unfair for me to ask her who she is with and what she is doing without having grounds to worry, if that makes any sense.

I brought it up with him and he agreed that he isn't including me in his future plans but didn't seem to want to alter them.

About 3 days ago I got invited by my friend and classmate (let's call her Katie) to spend this Saturday at an amusement park a few towns (let's call it town A) over, and also to maybe watch some movies. The company (X) she interns at is also located in town A and gives them cheap tickets to the amusement park and movies. I said sure, and asked her if I could invite some friends.

Katie and I are good friends, we've had some heart-to-heart but I don't want any kind of relationship with her, nor do I find her really *that* attractive.

I didn't want to sound mean over the phone but hearing everyone else has basically peaced makes me wonder if she has ulterior motives for inviting me over (to a party on Friday night, of all things).

t3_3fd3vo,"I met my girlfriend 3 years ago online. We've had a fairly tumultuous relationship - we both struggle with anger, and it leads predictably to a lot of fights. We've both been in counselling, and that's calmed down a lot. We've both been guilty of some nasty shit, and we've tried to forgive and leave it in the past.

However, there is one thing we've never been able to settle down on. I am decent with money, and she spends it like it grows on trees. I grew up in a lower middle-class household, and she grew up in a wealthy one. The issue is, although I hold down a good job as an engineer, I still expect her to contribute. We've struggled a lot with getting her to be responsible with money, and she's repeatedly admitted to spending all of her savings on useless shit - including junk food, when I pay for a personal trainer. 

I know, it's her money. It's not my business. However, she's promised me repeatedly that she's saving her money, and that became important recently when she lost her job. After that, it all came out of the woodwork - most of her savings are gone, some spent on her student loans, plenty spent on more useless shit and cheating on her diet. She has enough savings for maybe two months paying her necessary bills, which don't include paying me for room and board. I have counseled her repeatedly to make sure she has enough in savings for room and board for several months. Apparently she ignored it. 

This has happened before. She's never consistently paid me rent out of her own paychecks. When I've gotten rent, it's been from student loans for room and board.

I soon asked her out again, but she didn't get back to me for some time. I thought this was her shy way of letting me down gently; I've been turned down that way before and failed to recognize it the first time, being quite the socially unaware fool. I felt dumb for not being able to evaluate such an obvious thing and thinking she'd been interested in me - it'd be good to mention I'd had a change in anti-depressants at the time, so my mood was all sorts of whack.

I fell back into a depressive slump for about a week. This passed and I started considering asking her out one more time in person to see if my impression were reality or due only to poor self-esteem.

But, after failing to work up the nerve for that, I sexted a random girl online, had some fun, and then I found my courage the day after and asked for a second date. We set something up, and we've been on a few more since then.

t3_3hhohx,"Hi all, I'll try and make this quick! 

So my dog is laid up with a ligament tear, and has been for about 10 weeks.  She's obviously sick of being cooped up, but for the most part has been entirely chill about the whole process, but I was expecting a bit of a backslide in her training. 

Recently (last two weeks) she's been barking at people she doesn't recognize when I'm walking her to the bathroom at night.  To be fair, this is a relatively new apartment/ area for her, and she's been laid up and hasn't been able to explore/ meet the neighbors.

  It usually goes down like so: Milly sees a person in the distance and goes on alert (ears up, tail up, eyes focused). I usually at this point try to distract her with a, ""Hey, Milly, it's just our neighbor.  thanks for letting me know they are there!"" If they keep walking toward us, or we keep walking toward them, she usually breaks into the crazy greeting dance of her people (total wiggle butt, hoping side to side, ears up but relaxed).  We're working on a more relaxed greeting.  At this point I usually make her sit and stay by my side until she calms down.  
Well, if they don't move toward us (fair enough when she's clearly on alert), or she isn't allowed to get closer/ investigate she will bark.  Not a low bark, but a higher ""hey, you! Friend?"" kind of bark.  At this point I say, ""enough"" sternly and work with her until she will heel beside me and then we sit calmly once she's away from the stimulus. Once she completely calms down and has listened she gets a ""thank you"" and a treat.  I have a feeling this will go away once she has a chance to run/ play/ explore/ say hi to the neighbors and get some energy out, but maybe not, and I would like to curb the habit of barking at people, especially because she is rather large (in comparison to most dogs in the building) and sometimes she barks at people that already seem afraid of her.",dL2Aff39094mOhTKsLkJg8sCCFbirW,sup4_6b_t0.7," Dog barks at people she doesn't know, especially when they are walking past her and she is on alert.

It turns out that she is 16, which is still within the legal age range.

Today I got a series of terrifying messages on Skype from this girl. She said that the entire time she had planned on ""taking my virginity then cutting me open with a knife and making me love her or else she would kill me.""

t3_3hnib4,"So my boyfriend and I have been going out for a little more then a year. Our relationship is pretty good and he's a really awesome person to be around.

Since our relationship commenced, a common theme on our nights out is my boyfriends newly divorced room mate not making enough effort to chat to women, despite clearly wanting to. At first I took my boyfriends desire to help his mate out, as pretty considerate. However as I'm now trying to restrict my drinking when we go out (something which my boyfriend made a point of), I'm much more aware of how my boyfriend is really just inflating his own ego through chatting to these women.

This culminated a few weeks ago when my boyfriend, while rather drunk, told me there was no point of him going out while in a relationship unless his mate was going to fuck a random chick. When I then asked what the point of a night out was for me, he replied 'to provide social validation [for previously mentioned friend]' awesome right?

I trust he's been faithful throughout our relationship & will continue to be so, but it still makes me feel shitty when he spends extended periods talking to these other women,or pointing out 'cuties' for his mate to chat to, while I'm struggling with boredom because I can't drink as much as I used to. 
He talks about leaving me whenever I even joke about other guys (guys need to give up dread game -.- I value the relationship not because I fear losing him but because he genuinely adds to my life.)

We started texting/calling back and forth and she seemed into me (long thoughtful responses, exclamation marks, the odd emoji). I asked her out on a second date a week ago and she said yes. The date was set to be today, the day after our second freshman meetup so I texted her saying something along the lines of ""Aren't I lucky I get to spend two days in a row with you!"" to which she responded positively.

Our second date was to be today, the day after another first year meetup. I wasn't particularly flirty with her at the meetup but when I got home I sent her a text saying something along the lines of ""I gotta be up early because I'm lucky enough to be spending the afternoon with a special someone!

We talked for about four hours about a bad experience with his high school sweetheart (she cheated a couple times and dragged him along for a while).

She gave me a half hug, did not look up from the machine to make eye contact nor did she thank me.

t3_3irukr,"I'm coming to you with a weird problem which has probably occurred before. However, I am curious to see what others think about this problem, and if anyone has any tips for dealing with it.
A few months ago I had a falling out with someone I considered a great friend. I won't really go into details other than to say that we were both at fault with our shitty behaviours. Nevertheless, I am trying to put this episode in the past. However, we are no longer friends at all anymore.

However, we have a lot of mutual friends. I have purposefully kept quiet about the situation to avoid drama, but my former friend seems to have been gossiping to her close friends about me. So it appears that there's a whole group of people who think I'm not worth being around.

Normally that wouldn't annoy me, because I have a lot of good friends and not a whole lot of free time due to my job, career prospects, etc. However, I do occasionally have to see this former friend at parties. Usually her group of friends is with her and I can't help but feel anxious when I know I'm going to be seeing her. However, these gatherings are the only times I get to see some of my other friends, so I don't want to avoid them altogether.

Has anyone ever been in similar position here? How did you deal with it? I have a feeling that even if I try saying a polite hello, my former friend will just ignore me. Should I even try to be polite? I want to avoid awkwardness but it's difficult when you have mutual friends who don't know what happened. But I can't help but feel really keen anxiety when I think about having to interact with her. I really don't want to, but I want to see my friends. 

Do you recommend talking to my friends about what's happened, or just staying quiet for now?

There was this girl who said she liked me and that she needed someone to talk to because ""everyone hates her"", so we started talking.

A while later, i went to start another convo on facebook with her, and it had appeared that i couldn't reply to her anymore, nor could I view her profile. I had found out she had blocked me.

t3_3ji3zr,"Good Morning/Afternoon r/advice, 

Never posted on Reddit before at all, but I figured (based on the overall reliability of you nice individuals) that now would be a good time to start. 

About a year ago I moved away from my Midwest town to the west coast for work, and have just recently moved back. I was calling the Utility providers in my area to set up the gas/water/elec for my new place, but I was informed that gas could not be set up due to owing a past amount. 

I am generally good about keeping up on those things, but am only human so I assumed I would have a small sum to pay. Maybe one months worth that I missed at the end of a lease or something like that. I was alarmed however when  I was told that the value was around $500.00 from a home that I shared with friends in college. They stated that this amount was accrued in 2013.

I have spent the last 3 days trying to find the exact time when we moved from that specific house ( it was college, so we had a new place basically every year) and just now found out that the lease was over on 05/31/2012. Basically, whoever took over residency didn't change the service into their name and I did not request cancellation (first house, never had to pay utilities in the previously ""managed"" apartments as they were included in rent, other excuses). 

My question is, am I really on the hook for these fees and what recourse could I possibly have? I cannot afford to pay it, but I also don't think that it should be on me TO pay it. Any advice is truly appreciated as I have not had any experience with this type of thing before.",3AFaFd3w9NjDGnO51kupLyK1N44DQ2,ref," Didn't cancel gas from a house in college.

t3_3jmnus,"Hello,
I don't know if this is so much a legal question or more of a responsibility question- So I moved out of my studio last month paying $650 per month in Chicago. I moved down the block to someone off of Craigslist because I thought the place was great. A house in a city with a porch! I love porches! But living there for a few days, I found that I didn't inspect the place well enough- the place is pretty ratty for a number of reasons, and my roommate doesn't seem that motivated to make improvements. He's a nice guy, but not really the cleanest. The situation is kind of awkward since when I brought up making improvements or contacting the landlord, he didn't seem that enthusiastic and basically responded that the landlord was unlikely to respond to fixing our broken sink and things like that. Well anyways, I found a much cheaper place ($300 cheaper per month! It's just not nearly as convenient a location: 2 miles from train instead of a block). But the people are already my friends and I think I could be a lot more relaxed there. The newer place would actually feel like my place instead of living in someone else's place.

My question is this- since my roommate described it as a month to month deal, here are my questions- 
•	Whose responsibility is it to find someone to take over my room?
•	How much advanced warning should I give my current roommate without making this too weird? Immediately?
•	Should I tell him I'm leaving cuz the place sucks or should I say I found a much cheaper living situation?
•	How can I protect myself in this situation?

I literally have not signed a thing and my name is not on anything. That may have been really irresponsible since  I don't really have any protection but I don't have any responsibilities either necessarily.

The trouble is that she is 17 years old  (18 shortly after new year) and I'm concerned that the age gap is too large considering how young she is.

t3_3k95v1,"As with most stories on here, this happened a couple of days ago (Monday). I went to a large Labor Day party in the town I live in, at the request of some of my friends who were playing music at said party. I was standing in front of the stage, just zoning out and listening to the guys play. 

All of a sudden, I noticed two (lady) arms shooting out around my sides. I ignored it thinking she was trying to dance with someone behind me. She continues to dance and makes her way in front of me. I'm still kinda just zoning out and don't really pay much attention, until her face is about two inches away from mine. She asks me if I'm having a good time and I of course say yes. She then asks why I'm not dancing, and I lie and say I don't know how. I proceed to do a kind of stupid shimmy thing, because why be serious? 

She laughed and said that was how she danced too, and started doing it next to me. I continued to do so for a minute or so, and then stopped. She leaned in again and said something, but I couldn't hear her over the music. Instead of asking her to repeat herself, or moving away from the stage and speakers to talk, I proceeded to just give her a small smile, like she said something funny. She kept dancing next to me for a few songs, gave me a weird look, and left with her friend, who I guess was behind me the entire time. 

About fifteen minutes later, the band takes a break, and my buddy who was playing came up to me and asked me why I didn't dance with the girl. Evidently from the stage he saw her make a beeline for me from the back of the party. Of course, I had just assumed she knew someone in the band and just wanted to be close to the stage.

My brother and I aren't exactly very close. We were ok when younger, but drifted as we became teenagers. Our lives have completely different paths. Up until recently, he was working up north in Canada. Then his girlfriend (of 6 years) left him a couple days ago, and it really messed with his head. He missed work, which hadn't been going well in the first place, and was fired. Now he is alone up North with nothing to do but get drunk. We talked at 8:30 AM and he was already drunk. He then got a DUI later that day. 

He is coming back to live with our dad soon, but we don't know when. Dad is too busy to pick him up, and so is my Mom. So his ex is supposed to give him a ride down. I don't know the details of their breakup, but I don't really blame her for leaving. I don't think them being together in a car is a good idea. In the meantime, I'm worried for him because he is alone and getting drunk. I'm scared that he will get into a pit of despair and kill himself.

t3_3mrzj9,"Hi relationships,

This is sort of silly but something I have been going back and forth on for a few weeks now. I have been dating my amazing boyfriend for just over a year and in a month or so we are traveling to my home country for my best uni friends wedding. He has visited once before to meet a different group of college friends and had a great time and everyone loved him. I am so very excited for my best friends wedding in a few weeks except for one overshadowing issue. 

My ex-boyfriend who I dated for 1.5yrs in university will also be in the wedding party, we ended on really rocky terms. He hurt me badly and I didn't react well, it's not something I'm proud of. I ended up losing several friends in the process which is something I still feel a lot of guilt and shame about but have chalked it up as a learning experience and think I am more mature for the experience. My ex and I are more or less cordial but I have yet to tell my boyfriend that this guy will be at the wedding. I usually am the first to advocate for open communication and honesty, but this feels like a potentially double edged sword. I don't want to hurt my boyfriend by telling him therefore making him think there is still something there and this guys presence is something he should be worried about, but on the flip side I also don't want him to think I am intentionally hiding something from him.

My boyfriend already knows that I am anxious about the wedding and seeing people who I have not seen in 4+ years. Do you think it is okay to leave it at that high level, knowing that he has no interest to hear about past relationships, or should I give him a heads up about my ex? I have discussed with my therapist who thinks high level would be fine but I am leaning toward telling him just in case someone says something at the event.  I truly do not want to cause smoke where there is no fire if that makes sense, since I have no feelings toward my ex and absolutely do not want to hurt or worry my boyfriend unnecessarily.",alXFyfl0bJ3os3Tr45NF9sZOYe8gZW,sup4_12b, Do I tell my boyfriend my ex will be at a mutual friends wedding or leave it at high level and let him know I am anxious about it?,4.0
t3_3mwnhs,"My past three relationships have all been about 2 years, and I've ended all of them because of a combination of problems and me losing interest. 

The current girl I'm with has mostly everything I would want in a relationship - but I'm feeling myself starting to lose interest anyway. She does have a fairly bad jealousy problem, but some of it is warranted and I feel that everyone has to have some personal defects which should be forgiven.

One factor which I think contributes to feeling unsatisfied is that I tend to get what my friend calls a ""wandering eye."" Even though I'm happy with my gf I can't help noticing other girls around and being drawn to them, even catching myself flirting at times. A lot of it is sexual attraction and desire - it seems horrible but after being with my gf almost a year I'm less interested in sex and occasionally get a rush of excitement when I notice another girl showing interest in me. 

I could just date indefinitely but I do want to settle down and have kids. I just always get the feeling that I can't stay satisfied with my relationships, and if I'm getting this restlessness after only a year or two I can't imagine how it would be over the rest of my lifetime. 

An obvious answer would be to decide which is more important, dating different people or settling down, and then have the self control to stick to the decision. It's just that long term I *want* to settle down, but I can never escape the feeling of wanting to pursue other girls.

t3_3mz0i7,"this applies to my current 1 year relationship with my bf but is more of a general question. I always hear over and over how lack of trust is the #1 dealbreaker in so many relationships, but I honestly feel like being reserved or holding back is just a smart move for alot of reasons. If for example my bf is out for the night and not responding to texts that's ok and I'm not going to interrogate him or go through his texts when I see him, I just mean in a more general sense, as in I feel being reserved and protecting myself/not trusting him all the way is just the right thing to do generally. I have felt this way in all relationships I've ever had and I see no reason to change really. You never really know someone's true thoughts or feelings, and if you open up you are just going to get hurt, so why not enjoy your relationship while also protecting yourself on some level. He (or anybody else) will never have me completely but I don't think our relationship suffers for it.

Can anyone explain why this is so important to many people? I am not a sociopath I swear, just cautious and I don't see why I should change, but it is a problem to other people I have dated. I feel you can enjoy relationships and love without a deep level of trust and it's not as important to me as it is to others.

Recently, a lot of my friends have been talking about how they've started making out with girls, and I got a little jealous. I WAS 16 and I'd never kissed a girl before, and to be fair I'm a tad nerdy.

   So yesterday I'm hanging out with my best friend, also 16 although he goes to a different school, and a good coxswain (someone who steers the boat) friend (girl), a senior at a different school than me. After I drop off my (guy) friend, I start driving her back home as well. Since we're actually good friends, we start talking candidly, and eventually the conversation moves to kissing and relationships (she broke up with her boyfriend.)

 
   Before I know it, I'm asking her if she'd ever kiss me, and she said only if I don't tell anyone. So we start making out for the next 10 minutes. But today (the next day), I'm in a bind. I've texted and snapped her a few times but she's hardly replied, and her and I are meeting up again this saturday for her birthday. But I'm worried for many many reasons.

1) I feel like we're taking things too fast and it'll just ruin what we have

2) Although she does reply, I have to initiate the conversation first.

Around the start of he summer I told him that I really liked him, and that I really wanted to be exclusive with him. He was open about how he felt and asked how I would feel dating I guy in his 40s.

For example, we work together and he was leaving early for a doc appt so I decided to walk out to the parking lot with him. He kept saying, ""It's ok"" and ""I'm fine you don't have to worry"", when all I was doing was just walking him out because I felt like it. 

Another example was we hadn't really spent much time together in the past few weeks and so when we finally were able to hang out together I told him that I missed him. He looked at me weird and said, ""But I see you all the time...."", totally blowing off the fact that this was the first time we actually got to hang out in a while.

Here is my situation, I have recently entered a relationship for the first time since high school (some might say my first ever).  After being single for basically my entire life I am kind of having trouble getting out of the single mindset.

I really like my girlfriend, she has similar interests, very attractive, good major in college, the sex is really good, and we laugh a lot.  Still with all of this I find myself taken aback when I realize I can't pursue other girls.

I haven't had any slips so far, and I am trying really hard to not view other girls in a sexual way, but it can be quite hard when they start flirting with me.

So my question is, how can I work towards being comfortable being in a relationship?  I want to give this thing my best shot, since I think we are really good together.

My parents have just recently made a deal with the bank (to clear their debt if they sell the properties they own). As part of the deal, they get to move to an older home that needs a lot of work. Obviously they need money to do this house up, but the bank watches their accounts very carefully.

My mom asked me if she could keep €12,000 in my bank account (€3,000 at first and then another €9,000) so that the bank doesn't know about it and take it off them. I said yes because I know they're really stressed about all this and I wanted to help in any way I could. I was kind of worried that I might get in trouble for it, but decided to trust her. She's asked me to take the money out in lots of €500 euro multiple times a week, so that she can pay the guys who are working on the house.

I know this all sounds very dodgy, but I'm certain this money hasn't come from drugs, robberies, etc. I know that my mom used my name/Personal Public Service Number to pay ""me"" for ""hours that I worked"" in their shop, so I think that's probably where the money came from (probably not much better in the eyes of the law).

t3_3qfwci,"My gf's parents are strict Muslims and won't let her date anyone who isn't a Muslim (for the record, we're in North America, so this isn't unusual for me to not be Muslim).

We have four options:

* She come comes out and says she's dating me, an non-Muslim and gets disowned and is never allowed to speak to family again. She has a bf she loves, but is sad because of no family.

* I pretend to convert, we can still see each other, she keeps her family and a roof over her head. **She knows about me pretending to convert, it's her parents that don't know I'm pretending**

* We break up, she keeps family, but is sad because she has no bf who loves her.

* We wait until she is able to move out in about a year on good terms with her parents. However until then, it's basically a long distance relationship, which is something that I think would be difficult to maintain this for such a long time

The second choice seems more desirable, as it satisfies all parties, however this is still a big commitment, and opens up the possibility to further messes down the road. My concern is that option 2 seems like a temporary fix, and could backfire in the future. However the permanence of 1 and 3 options is also very concerning to both of us.

t3_3qtbmi,"Hi reddit, first time posting. I have been lurking for a while.

I've been with my boyfriend Alex for 12 months. We live together, and have a good relationship apart from little arguments about chores and stuff.

Lately he has been acting like we're not having sex enough. He will drop things in the conversation about how he doesn't feel attractive, and if his weight is a problem (it isn't, he's pretty ripped) and asks why I don't touch him more. Just general things like that. When I try to tell him I don't think we have sex too little, he agrees with me and acts like nothing is wrong, but in a way that tells me he just doesn't want to upset me.

I do reject him 50% of the times he tries to start something. I have a weak immune system, and I get sick alot and don't really feel like sleeping with him. Another thing is I recently went through losing a 5 week old puppy I rescued and bottlefed to parvovirus. I don't want to bring this up to him because it will sound like an excuse, but I nursed that little guy and syringe fed him for 2 weeks and losing him really messed me up.

I'm rambling a bit, so my main problem with him acting like this is I think we have sex more than enough. On an average day, we have sex 4-5 times in a long session, rather than multiple single times a day. I'm wondering if maybe he doesn't see it as much because it's all in one big chunk. I make sure we do it so much because I want to keep him satisfied, even if I'm not feeling 100%. I can't help but feel a bit unappreciated. 

Mainly asking this so I can read your responses and see high libido perspectives, and so we can see what people think after we have a talk about it.",uvzut5OK2bvei9zoCDdktcfLENYioY,sup4_6b," Boyfriend acts like we don't have sex enough, I think we do, but I'm not sure.

Well I'm currently a college student in a big college party city and I'm just not into alcohol. It seems to be such a taboo to the point where I have arguments with my girlfriend (F18) about it. 

I am majoring in business and I plan on doing business in Far East Asia, specifically China and I keep getting told I'm going to need to drink if I'm going to be a business major. 

I just don't want to drink. Nothing is wrong with alcohol, I just don't want to do it. I can't seem to pinpoint why though but I know I don't want to do it. Beer is the only thing I've tried and I plainly don't like it.

I don't like partying because it's basically drinking around these parts.

I don't tell her she's pretty very often or don't compliment her much. I feel terrible about it, but this time I was really trying to change for her.

For Halloween she went to visit her step brother at a college and I got drunk with my friends and watched movies. Last night (11/1) we got in a huge fight about me not changing and how our relationship won't work out and basically broke up over the phone. So in an effort to try and fix it I drove to her house. She told me how at the parties she went to that two guys kissed her. The first one she pushed away, but the second one I asked her if she kissed him back and she said yes and that she did it because it made her feel wanted, which I guess I haven't been making her feel that way lately. We cried, we talked about everything, we had great sex, and I stayed over at her house just to sleep with her and then snuck out in the morning so her parents wouldn't know.

We both obviously want to work things out but aren't sure if we should. I love this girl, but the more I think about it, all I can think about is her cheating on me, and more importantly, liking it.

t3_3s0cjs,"Hey guys! 

this is the age old question, I'm in love with a good friend. Met in high school, had a crush on her but I wasn't confident enough at the time due to personal self-esteem issues and never spilled the beans. 

2 years later, feelings still persist and now that I've had a chance to work through my issues some of that confident has been regained and now it's constantly nagging me that I haven't told her how I feel. 

I don't expect her to feel the same way about me, at this point I want to tell her just so it's out in the open and I can get some peace of mind. 

The problem is that during the four years we've been friends, we've become pretty close and I'm scared of losing the friendship and of making her feel like the past 3 years of friendship have been me trying to get in a relationship with her, which they haven't. Her friendship has been an honest and delightful one. 

 She honestly makes me happy, we have similar senses of humor, she's one of the smartest and most beautiful people I know. but I think the friendship is ultimately more important than any other feelings I have for her but I don't know how to convey that without sounding like I'm making excuses for myself and undermining the last three years. 

Like I said, I'm not expecting a relationship. Just because my eyes light up because of her doesn't mean hers will do the same because of me.

t3_3s5c91,"Hi,

My ex broke up with me because she didn't feel the same way anymore and wanted to move on and meet other guys, which according to what she told me, did happen already. I am 100% aware that the relationship is over and I am 100% trying to move on right now.

My friends are extremely supportive and they always chill and distract me until late at night when they go home. I also got new hobbies like lifting, got a new haircut and did changes to my life to try and be a brand new person. However, I am having problems like not being able to sleep at night and even if I do, end up waking up extremely early. 

At night, my heart will keep on pounding like a race horse when I am alone and no matter how hard I try I cannot distract the feeling. When I watch a tv show or play games the feeling stays and distracts me from whatever I am doing. When I finally fall asleep at 3AM I always end up waking up at around 7:30AM~ with strong thoughts on her and my heart pounding really fast again.

t3_3te9pk,"So, this is about 4 years ago. I was a sophomore in highschool. 
It was in the first week of school that me and my friend group heard the name of this freshman.. He had an awesome name. Idk how i can make something comparable.. We'll call him Barry Powers. It wad like that, a superhero type name. So anyway, we heard the name Barry Powers during freshman roll call and we were like ""damn! What a sick name!"" And made it our ultimate mission to find this guy.
And so we searched.
It took weeks. 
Whenever we met other freshmen, we asked, ""do you know Barry Powers?"" And other questions like ""what does he look like?"", ""where did you last see him?"", and ""where can we find him?"".  We really wanted to find this kid and congratulate him on his name.
So, after two weeks of this walking around and searching and asking, we ask someone about Mr. Powers and their answer is ""oh, he's right there.""  we get freakin hyped and beeline to the dude, who looks at us with fear in his eyes. Thinking back on it, we had the poor kid, who was eating lunch on his own, in a corner surround by 4 of us. I asked, ""hey man. You Barry Powers?""
""y-yeah.."" He managed to respond. 
""oh, well, you have a sweet name!"" I said.
""ok.."" Mumbled Powers. Now, the next moment was like the end of an always sunny episode; my friends and I looked around and each other and decided, ""oh cool we did it, moving on now.""
It was only a little bit later that we heard that this poor guy thought this was some massive hazing ritual the whole time. And since we had asked so many people, most of the freshman class thought here was some crazy hazing where we chose one random dude, hunted him down, and did something to him.

t3_3tginb,"This FU happened in December of last year, so forgive me, and is possibly one of my worst.

So my very closest friend in the world (let's call him AssHat) loves to troll me. I, in turn, enjoy trolling him back. Recently, he received a dare to post something serious to his facebook as part of a prank. The way the prank works is that if somebody messages you about the serious thing you posted, you are given something by them to post on your wall. The joke spreads around like that, and is sort of stupid in my opinion. A few days later, I see he has posted to his wall ""My Grandmother went to heaven today."" With the odd wording, and me hearing nothing of his grandma's ill health, I assumed it was another one of his prank posts to lure more people in to his silly joke. I thought it would be rather funny to mess with some of the believers in the comments of the post.

I type ""Good riddance"" into the comments and, within seconds, I receive a reply from one of his friends I did not know saying ""That's horrible. Why would you say something like that?"" With a lack of better judgement, I decide not to hold back. I go on a rant spreading lies about his grandmother: ""She was a horrible person and a menace to society"", ""She even ran over my cat and never apologized"", ""I went to AssHat's house and saw alot of German WWII related items."", ""That monster was literally a nazi!"", ""She's scum of the earth and we're better off without her.""

I felt pretty accomplished with my trolling, not even considering the possibilty his grandmother could have actually died. Later that night, I returned to facebook only to see my comments had been deleted, and AssHat's comment about the awful things I had said. Turns out his Grandmother had actually died that day, and I was the worst best friend in the world. I of course apologized profusely, and attempted to explain myself, but he was still ticked at me for a couple of days.",uvzut5OK2bvei9zoCDdktcfLENYioY,ref," I called my friend's dead grandma a nazi only hours after her death thinking it was all an elaborate joke.

  Well, a little about myself. For starters, I'm gay. Most of my friends know lol. I'm really into (old) music. Goth, Punk, Deathrock, 80's indie/ jangle pop. I also like some non- alternative music, mostly old school. Some days, l look like l attended a Victorian funeral. Other days, l look like a cross dressing burlesque performer out of Tim Burton's mind. l also have a kick ass mohawk lol. Last l checked, it was almost 9 inches tall. But enough about me.

  Back to the problem. I feel no likes me. Well, no one has shown any interest. Maybe l'm being impatient? I don't know. I guess l feel unattractive. Unwanted, perhaps?

t3_3u4yzu,"This happened to me last Monday, and I still feel terrible.

My first year courses at university luckily landed me only one midterm, while my friends had multiple. Even better, this ""midterm"" was during week 10, so I had lots of time to ~~procrastinate~~ prepare.

Fast forward to the night before the midterm, I stayed up really late to study and prepare a page of notes we were allowed to take with us (it was a computing course). Once I was done, I couldn't wait to collapse on my bed so I set my alarm on my phone for 10  real quick and did just that (my midterm was at 11:30).

The next morning, or a couple hours earlier, I was woken up by voices of the janitors doing their daily cleaning. Groggily, I thought to myself, ""weird how they're so early today"" (they usually come around 11 am), and went to back to bed since my alarm didn't go off yet. This should have been a sign.

A while later, I woke up again and felt my sleep had strangely been going on for too long, since I was only supposed to get around 5 or 6 hours until my alarm was supposed to go off. 

With a dreading feeling, I walked to my phone and opened it: ""12:35 pm"". All the color drained from my face as I realized just how hard I screwed up by setting my alarm for 10 pm instead of 10 am.

After thinking for a while about what to do, I decided to email the professor to see if there was anything I could do to make up for it. I then proceeded to take a nap to finish my sleep and escape my anxiety. I wake up around 3:30 pm and check my email and am greeted by [this message](

t3_3u5dz6,"So I've been dating this girl for a month and on paper we are perfect for each other. On the outside, we have a lot in common in that we like the same kind of music, same food, same movies etc, but also on the inside we are the same in that, we are both quite independent, we both are ambitious, both have the same cultural values, but most importantly we approach life the same. I have met a lot of people in my life (due to my job and how my social life is) and I genuinely have very rarely met anyone who has the same approach to life as me but who I also want to pursue a relationship with.

However I have stumbled across a problem... Normally when I like a girl, I normally fall quite fast, quite hard for them. However, with this girl, only half the time do I feel infatuated for her, while the other half I'm not very bothered. E.g. Normally when a girl doesn't text me back for a couple of hours, I get quite concerned, but with her, I don't really pay attention. I'm quite confused as to why I'm not feeling fully infatuated with her - Is it because I either:

a) Am not really that interested in her. 

b) Realise that this relationship is doomed because she is moving back to her home country at the end of next year. 

c) Am still numb from the pain that my ex-girlfriend inflicted on me when she cheated on me a year ago.

d) Am growing up/have a job and therefore the feeling of infatuation has reduced, but I'm also too busy with work to care.

Girlfriend is in college during the week and we only see each other on weekends when she is back home. About 3/4 weeks ago she was not answering my texts or just being very aloof with me. When we met up at the weekend she eventually admitted that she has had depression before and is going through it again so she wanted to break up because in the past she has treated her boyfriends like shit during these periods and didn't want to do that to me. I said no, thanked her for telling me what was happening and then said we would get through this rough patch.  

So since then she has gone from texting me and talking throughout the day to maybe getting a text or two in reply to something I sent during the day. I know this sounds stupid but we have ended almost all of our texts for the past year with an ""x"" but she is even rarely doing that now. She is even purposefully ignoring texts as I get the read notification and if i get a reply it can be hours later.  

One part I can't understand is, when we are together at weekends things seem almost normal as she seems happy to see me, we hang out, sleep together etc.  
We even talk about possibly moving out together in the summer.

Hey people it seems like whenever i meet a girl or pays attention to me i end up becoming really needy of their attention and in a sense co dependent. I help them with everything no matter.

I've really liked living with him.  This place has a kitchen, so we cook our own food rather than eating at the dining hall.  Rather, I cook the food.  I get a lot out of making him breakfast in the morning and leaving it on his nighttable while he sleeps, or tidying up his room while he's out.  I don't really do it much in front of him because it makes him feel like he's in debt.  I've told him over and over that it isn't the case.  I actually really enjoy this sort of thing.

Thinking about moving back to the dorms and back with other roommates (none of whom I know) has been a bit depressing for me.  But honestly, the thing I'm going to miss most is taking care of my boyfriend the way I have been these past few months.  I've really liked this 'mom' role, much more than being a 'girlfriend'.  We always argue about sex, and we always argue about going on dates, but it's not like we argue because he doesn't like the food I've cooked.  Being a mom in this case is stress-free, while in the other cases feelings and emotions are always in play.  I just don't know if I'm going to cope well with going back to how our relationship used to be.

t3_3vymlo,"Hi.

When I was in fifth grade, at 2005, a beautiful girl asked me to be her friend; and we were together until six months ago, that's around 9-10 years. I can't remember the times I wasn't with her. I don't have a memory which doesn't include her.

I was never comfortable around people, and only with her I was relaxed, I could talk comfortably only with her, and we always said that we won't leave each ever. I was very happy.

And things start to get bad. I couldn't met her expectations. She got depressed, and I couldn't help her; I couldn't find correct words to say to her, and I couldn't make her happy. After the treatment for her depression, she (correctly) left me, and blocked me everywhere except one messaging service.

After that, I was just making myself believe that she'll be back, we'll be together and happy again. But she clearly isn't. Recently she told me that she's with someone else, he loves her very much etc. 

And there's me now. My only memories are with her, I don't talk with anyone except my coworkers. I don't feel *anything* since she left me, I'm not sad, I just don't want anything. I have a job and working for M.S degree, and I just *continue* them, without doing anything for my life. Every day I think about her for a few minutes, and I just feel angry, I don't know why.

She isn't returning, she made it pretty clear. But it left me in a pretty bad situation, without anyone to help. This is the first time I'm saying these.

Actually I don't know what I'm trying to achieve with this post. Maybe writing about it helps.

My wife was a school teacher but hated her life. At this time i was working full time and working on my degree.

t3_3ybwbp,"So, right now I live at home with my parents in NYC. I feel really stressed out about living with them-- like I'm a burden, like I get in their way. They also stress me out sometimes. I am very noise sensitive, and sometimes when they fight about things it makes me feel really non functional and ruins my day.

I was apartment hunting a bit because of this and found a place in the city that I thought was great. It's a little out of my budget long term, but it's month to month so I thought I could just get it for three months or so and not lose too much money on rent. I tentatively agreed to take it, but no money changed hands. The guy told me that someone else wanted it but that if I could pay the deposit before it her, the room was mine.

Then two days went by where I didn't hear from the guy renting the place. I assumed that someone else had taken it and they just didn't want to tell me (this has happened to me a lot looking for a room share). 

However while time went by I started thinking about it and decided I wasn't sure about this place. The rent is hundreds of dollars a month more than I could afford, and I would have a lot of roommates (about 7), so it wouldn't even be quiet, which is the main thing I'm looking for. 

The guy just got back to me today asking when I could make the deposit, and I had to tell him I wasn't sure I would. He wrote back saying they were counting on me taking the place and this would make a lot of problems for them. I feel bad about what happened, but I also don't think I should have to take this place when all I did was express interest. He also apparently forgot to call me back to discuss putting down the deposit, which made me lose confidence in him as a landlord.

After careful talking and collaboration with her, we decided that as a ""Christmas gift"" I would pay for her puppy. I am normally against the puppy for Christmas thing, but she wanted a puppy, the time of year just worked out like that. 

I have 3 dogs myself, all rescues, I wasn't overly familiar with the process of buying a dog. But I know enough to know that I did in fact end up supporting a puppy mill. 

This pup is a husky, he cost me $350, which is insanely cheap for a husky puppy (Sign #1). The ""breeder"" wouldn't let me on the property to see the dogs (Sign #2). The breeder also had no organization, no contracts, no vet records, no health certificate, nothing. I know I shouldn't have gotten the dog from him. I supported a puppy mill. This poor pup is stained with pee and feces. 

So why did I do it? I was so caught up in getting my friend a husky, which again she knew about, that I looked past my better judgement. 

Not to mention, upon meeting this guy to pick up the puppy, I was alone. I had gone to meet him before with my boyfriend and he said he was fine because we were meeting in a public place and he didn't seem weird last time.

As a baseline: we have roughly $750 left over from my paychecks after taking care of all of our set bills (Student Loans, Car Payment, etc.). We still need to eat, pay for gas, and prepare for general living expenses.

t3_3yztb2,"So about two weeks ago I met a girl on Tinder. We hit it off fairly quickly and began texting each other. A lot. We texted all day everyday for two weeks. Today, we finally met up. 

Before I get into that, let me just say that while texting, she sort of fell for me. I like her, too, but still, I hadn't met her so I didn't know how much. I had told her I was looking for more than a hookup, and she said the same. She kept telling me how self conscious she is of her body, how much weight she's gained, and would send me pics of her asking if I was okay with her body. In the pics she sent me, she did seem a little chubby, but still very cute. I reassured her that I found her attractive, because from the pics, I really did.

On to our date. We had a great time together. Spent about 10 hours in total, including some heavy making out and fooling around. The problem is, she's a lot heavier than I had been anticipating. So much so, that I am just not that attracted to her, and had trouble staying hard when we were fooling around.

We didn't have sex, because she said she wanted to wait until we were ""official"" as if it was inevitable (and I'll admit, through texting, I thought it was inevitable as well). I just don't know what to do. She's already asking me what to do for our next date, and talking about future plans together, and I'm just kind of going along with it because I'm terrified of hurting an already very self-conscious person. She's such a nice girl, and I feel like if I told her I wasn't feeling it, it would just destroy her. She told me it was the best date she's ever had, and one of the best days of her life.

t3_3zdkcd,"I should probably state that my best friend is also my ex. We were incredibly close during our year and a half together, and had a mutual breakup because we wanted to see new people/ I graduated college and got a full-time job about an hour away. Our breakup was mutual, and after a couple of months of no-contact, we recently rebuilt our friendship. I think of her as my closest friend, and actually, just a couple of days ago, she openly admitted the same about me.

Due to the distance, our only means of contact is through Facebook messenger. Since we started talking again though, I'd find that she'd frequently not respond to my last message, despite Facebook saying that she ""saw"" it. Sometimes we'd be having a fairly in-depth conversation (that she sometimes brings up), or she'd be ranting to me about something, when all of a sudden, her messages just stop. I realize that there are probably a number of reasons why she may not be replying; she's a lot more social than I am and often talks to multiple people at once, not all of my messages warrant a response, or that she's just busy, but it's still fairly annoying to see, especially since I'm the sort of individual that tries to send some sort of acknowledgement to all messages that I receive, or tell them if I can't talk at the moment. Because she doesn't always do this, I initially interpreted that she was sending me mixed messages shortly after we resumed contact.

I realize that yes, we're no longer in a relationship, and that I can't expect her to always be there, but I feel as if this issue also extends to courtesy, and I really would like to talk to her about this without trying to sound needy/ pushy (especially given our former status).

More frequently, however, they are talking very loudly into the night and seemingly moving furniture around/scraping up the floors. (My family owns the building which makes me really thrilled about the obvious floor scraping I hear... but that's neither here nor there.) 

Now, I recently found out that an ex-colleague of mine is good friends with the girl living upstairs. The ex-colleague and I are on friendly terms--we sometimes text and catch up on each other's lives. There have been times that I want to text ex-colleague and ask her to check up on her friend after hearing a nasty fight, but I refrain because it's none of my business. Anyway, it's important to me to stay on friendly terms with my ex-colleague because there is a very real chance we will become colleagues again in the next couple of years. I also work in a rather tight knit industry, so it would behoove me to just stay friendly either way.

I know that the upstairs girl knows that we have a mutual friend and would report back if I did anything passive aggressive.

I need to learn how to spend more time by myself and not be jealous if he has other friends but I just don't know how.

We got back together and had another kid together. Recently I found out she was with a guy that she worked with years ago. They had been ""friends"" and texting each other on and off over the years. But when  we weren't together she ended up sleeping with this guy. He had a girlfriend at the time, think he still does.

I recently confronted my partner about this and she told me that she didn't see any harm in texting him when we were together originally because ""nothing happened"". I'm finding it hard to believe that a guy would keep interest after 8 yrs (when they originally met) if he wasn't getting anywhere (unless they were just friends)

At his primary job they shut down during the winter break and he gets his paycheck monthly on the 15th so things have been tight for him for the January paycheck because he only worked about a 1/2-3/4 the hours he normally does.

Occasionally she'll call me 'hot stuff' or 'babe' but usually it's 'dude' or 'man'.  Her inconsistency in communicating makes me feel like she is not taking this seriously, or making an effort.

Especially with the lack of communication on her behalf. Sometimes I think she's just worried we're going to run out of conversation topics and that's why she replies so sporadically.

I don't plan my life, I just live it day by day, knowing that one of this days my doctors can tell me some bad news.

I met a girl. We got to know each other a bit. We dated intensely for a week. I was falling HARD, and way too fast... it felt disproportionate to how well we knew each other.

Today we have been given a document stating it's an amendment to our contract amednmnd the changes are to be implemented immediately.

My problem is I have an interview lined up 31 March. I've had a first interview with the company (1 march) and they have called me back for a second interview. 

I calculate the costs I would owe my current employer as £530. I only earn £1,106 at present and cannot afford to lose that amount from my pay or I cannot afford to pay my half of the bills/rent and my SO wouldn't have the available funds to help me out.

Can I refuse to sign this document? What is the smartest move here considering I did not agree to these costs prior to taking the exams and certainly wouldn't have sat them if I had known?

My issue is that I don't want to kick up a fuss and create tension if I don't end up getting the job. But on the other hand, the interview is promising (I have a friend at the company and the Directors I've already met have apparently gone up to her and told her how impressed hey were... so I'm hopeful).

I think that's enough info.... but happy to expand if necessary.

t3_49wwf5,"Hello, lets start with some ""names"".  My girlfriend's ""name"" is Megan, and my 2 friends involved are ""Julia"" and ""Hannah""

I hope to make this brief.  So my girlfriend and I have been dating for 6 months, she is fabulous, our relationship is really great. However, I learned something today that I found slightly troubling.  Long story short, it seems my girlfriend doesnt like very much when I hang out with my two friends Julia and Hannah.  Today my gf was out of town for something school related, so I hanged with my two friends.  I always gave Megan info like ""yeah i think ima hang with Julia and Hanna when you're out of town"" and she usually says something like ""haha okay sounds good.""  And I ask her ""you're fine with that right"" and she'd say ""With Julia? Ya of course."" There has been a few times where like we'd go to Spot coffee and get some food together, always the 3 of us (Me, Julia, and Hannah). I have always believed Megan had not cared... until today.  

Today Julia and Hannah told me that Megan isnt always very nice to them.  Such as, giving ""looks"" to them in the hall.  Or not saying Hi if they see each other.  Apparently Megan only says hello and stuff when Im with her.  Anyway, I never knew this.  As I said, Megan always seemed perfectly fine with me hanging out with my friends.  In addition, she has a good amount of guy friends, so its not like she doesnt understand..  I hang out with Megan a lot, just not ALL the time, I like hanging with friends too.

In the end, I would like to talk to Megan about this (In person, not text).  How can I bring this out without sounding like I am ""accusing"" her, I just wanna talk about their concerns.

The relationship was great for roughly 7/8 months. We hit a rough patch towards the end of December.

On her trip, she went with some family friend (not of her's, I think her aunt's) and now she ""realizes"" that he is better than me.. 

I think I loved her (she loved me a lot). When I say I ""think I loved her"" it's more because I have an issue with loneliness, and settle when someone I ""think"" I like comes by. Now I'm jealous, feeling very alone, and unsure if I can ever give enough.

So I've been in a relationship with my boyfriend for three and a half years now, and I regularly stay at his house where he still lives with his parents and brother. I've been pretty friendly with his brother this whole time but I have a feeling he may dislike me...

 We talk sometimes and he will show me things he thinks I'll like, like videos or music, and will watch TV with my boyfriend and I, which all says that he does think of me in a good way. 

But he will sometimes seemingly go out of his way to ignore me, like sitting at the other end of the house instead of in his room near us (which he would never do if it was just my boyfriend there), and he won't ever sit next to me.

4 months ago my partner of 5.5 years left me to pursue a relationship with a girl from work. As I know, he didn't *actually* cheat on me, however in my heart it feels the same--if not worse because he actually PURSUED a relationship, not just sex. He said he regretted it pretty early on but they continued to be together for two months, and not once did he try to contact me to work things out. 

It was short lived, apparently, and he's back saying he fucked up and he realized his mistakes and ""realized"" that what we have is a once in a lifetime sort of thing. I'm hesitant. I feel so hurt and betrayed, and I feel very disillusioned about our relationship in general. I love him and I am still so very much in love with him, but I just don't really feel as though he won't ever experience grass is greener syndrome again.

I'm a 22 M and have been dating my 22 F girlfriend for about 11 months now. What started off smoldering has really faded out the past few months. She was originally going to go to California for Grad School and decided to stay where we live to be with me essentially. I didn't ask her to do this, I advocated for her to leave. Ultimately I supported her decision because that's what you're supposed to do. Fast forward a couple of months later we are living together and everything is great, but we've only been together a few months. Over the course of the past few months I've become increasingly annoyed by her for no apparent reason. She's extremely needy and clingy and wants words of affirmation/kisses/cuddles constantly, but I don't feel the want to kiss her very often. I have begun to see her as more of a great friend whom I love, but I'm  not sure if I am in love with her. Are there any tips for becoming less annoyed from anyone in a similar situation?

One of the things I wondered about is if MFP is setting my calorie intake goal too high. Currently it says I should aim for 1330 per day to lose 2 pounds a week. I didn't think anything of it until I saw a post earlier where someone mentioned determining your TDEE on your own. When I did that, it showed my calorie intake should be 1234 per day to lose 2lbs.

He's always been intolerant of garlic and onion, but when we met it was far more mild. I never even knew he allergic for the first year we dated. We ate garlic fries once and he got pretty sick, and that was the first time he admitted it to me.

It's become extremely bad in the past 5 months. He gets sick even from cooked garlic and onion. His worst episode happened recently (he was shivering and having full body spasms with severe abdominal pain, followed by an entire night of running to the toilet). I put my foot down after that. No more cooking with garlic or onion (which is devastating for me, because I ABSOLUTELY ADORE THE SHIT OUT OF THOSE INGREDIENTS). We've tried to be super careful at restaurants, but it's almost impossible to avoid them. This has lead to him pushing for us to just go ahead and do it, and him winding up sick.

I need some ideas about how best to support him so he doesn't feel like he's letting me down, or repressed and stuck eating bland food.

Then I thought I'd want to pursue a career in international relations or something like that, but I just didn't want to go into more debt with more school. About a year after I graduated, I started to work as a substitute teacher, so I figured I'd pursue teaching. While getting into an alt cert program, I started working at Ross (the store) in October of 2014. While at Ross, I had so much pressure on me to find a teaching job with health insurance. Fast-forward to August 2015, I finally got a teaching job! But that job was hell on earth. I suffered from anxiety and panic attacks, so after two months, I had to quit. I went to a therapist (which I'm still seeing) and I'm doing much better, so now I have a job at Sears.

t3_4etjlm,"Hi, legaladvice. I can't believe I'm in this situation.

I was recently promoted to Store Manager of a grocery store after the original manager quit (I was assisstant manager before for about 6 months).

We hired a woman, let's call her Sally, a couple of weeks ago. She's not terrible at her job (just basic cashier stuff) but she refuses to process payments that equal $6.66. I know, it sounds crazy.

Our store prices everything ending in 28 cents as a ploy (kinda like Brandsmart). So anything priced at $6.28 will ring up to $6.66 after tax, and it happens quite often that people will buy just that one item (which I've learned after Sally started working here).

Every time this happens, one of the managers or supervisors has to take over because she refuses and sometimes it throws a spanner in the works. I brought it up with HR and they said I can't do anything about it because it's her religious freedom (since 666 is the number of the beast in Christianity).

The thing is, we have the same religion; we even go to the same church! But I don't think she should be able to use that excuse to not ring those transactions. I've offered to move her to another part of the store but she doesn't want to stock or do anything else.

HR warned me not to decrease her hours or I'd get in trouble, but I just don't see how I can do my job properly if I have to take care of petty stuff like this.

Is there a law or something that says I'm right? I don't want to go back to HR without knowing I'm 100% right that she shouldn't have the job if she can't perform all aspects of it.

And if I'm wrong, I suppose I can bear it even if I do think it's ridiculous.",OKFDIsAZl6Qa0m9x26f5Ao4S0uc7Ca,pretrain_6b_t.7, I'm a store manager at a grocery store and I want to fire a cashier because she refuses to process transactions ending in $6.66.

I'm not sure what the problem was because we were pretty close. She didn't even give anything a chance, but I suspect this had to do with her relatively recent breakup.

Every women I've been with or been ""talking"" has said I'm too attractive for them. Idk if that's even related, but it's like they think they aren't good enough for me when I try to become more than friends. Sometimes I think how much easier it'd be if I was gay lol.

I've been dating my boyfriend for about 6 months.  I think the sex is great, but he's more experienced that I am.  So far, he's seemed to enjoy it.  

I do have a bit of an issue with premature ejaculation, but there's ways we can do it to avoid it (i.e. changing positions, etc).  

However, the other day, we were having sex (I was the receptive partner) and I finished about a minute before he did.  He didn't notice, and after he finished, he made a comment about it being my turn to finish.  I told him I already had, and he goes ""I thought I might've come first..... for once.""  It was a kind of off putting.  He knows its a sensitive subject (LOL).

I told him I was trying my best and doing techniques to last longer each time, to which he replied, ""you know, you could just go on an SSRI, that would just fix everything.""

I kinda laughed it off, but I was really turned off by that comment.   I'm not opposed to medications at all for their intended use, but asking your SO to go on an SSRI seems pretty serious, especially just for the sexual side effects.

t3_4ih0b7,"I'm doing much better now, but two or three years ago I went through a pretty bad time. I ended up with several relatively light scars on my forearms, belly, and upper thighs. Those ones are usually not noticeable and while some people point them out they're pretty easy to shrug off. However, I also have much deeper scars running up the entirety of my upper arms, and now that it's summer again and I'm going out in tshirts and tank tops, people won't stop asking about them. They're raised and heavy and very obviously self-inflicted. 

It seems like everyone from my boss to my Spanish professor (in front of the whole class, which is what prompted this post) has pointed them out. Some people are nice about it, and of course some are really rude, but it always makes me uncomfortable because I just don't know what to tell them.

I've tried covering the scars with concealer and followed some home remedies to make them less noticeable but nothing has really worked so far. I don't think they're going away any time soon, and I'm in the American south so it would be difficult to spend all summer in long sleeves or sweaters. 

I don't want to feel like my scars are something I should be ashamed of for the rest of my life. But I also don't want to be stuck explaining a very personal and painful part of my history to strangers all the time. With little kids I can spin some crazy story and laugh about it, with adults I usually tell them they're just old scars, but some people really won't take the hint. One of my coworkers straight up told me I was just looking for attention after I tried to shrug it off. But I don't want attention or pity or a therapy session with strangers; I just want to be able to wear short sleeves this summer.

I can't figure out where it is because the flash was on the the room behind him in the pictures is dark.

Sometimes in these situations people kind of glance around to others waiting for visual commiseration of some sort, surely many of you reading have probably experienced this. 

The cute guy kind of glanced back at me and smiled but I had one of my headphones in listening to music, so I nodded back. I kept noticing him kind of attempting to look my way (or possibly he was just annoyed and waiting, hard to tell).

t3_4nn1qe,"Hello!

I am currently renting an apartment in Philadelphia for 800 dollars and am planning to move out at the end of June (the end of my lease). Unfortunately, I made the great mistake of forgetting that there was a line in my lease that states it automatically renews unless I tell my landlord 60 days in advance that I will not be renewing. Instead I told him 45 days in advance. I was then told I am on the hook for another 12 months with an increase in rent (850) unless another person takes the lease.

 On the positive side, the real estate agency that works for my landlord is attempting to find a leaser now, but since the landlord wants 850 for the lease, it is proving a challenge for the agent to find someone. In the meantime, I've found a cheaper apartment including utilities down the street and already put a deposit down (685 for deposit + 345 for half month of rent). It should be noted that my current apartment is extremely expensive because of the inefficient heating (160/month in winter) and it's in a rundown old building.

My question is that if a person cannot be found for my current lease, does it make sense to lose my deposit at the other apartment complex and just stay at my current apartment? Or should I gamble that someone will be found by the agent in the next two weeks? Or should I pay a month of double rent in the hopes that someone takes the lease by the end of July. However, I cannot afford to pay the two leases at the same time for an extending period of time(poor, stupid grad student on loans).

I understand that my woes are caused by my own mistake of not being aware of my own lease, but I am trying to rectify the situation now with your help.

Before that I worked freelance as a graphic/web designer and photographer but it wasn't enough to make a decent living. I own professional equipment and have 5 weddings under my belt, but my biggest problem is self-promotion and advertising (I'm not the most confident person when it comes to selling myself). At this new job, I'm working 40+ hours a week making $15/hr. The job is related to my field (graphic design), but it's not a creative position. I'm basically pumping out orders for this company based off of templates. The first few months were okay since I was learning new techniques and a new program, but now I feel like a robot and this place is sucking the life/energy out of me. There is no sick time, no personal time, the building itself is not well-maintained, and there is nowhere to move up in the company. The only thing keeping me going is the idea that it's not permanent. My plan was to make it a year at this place, save some money, and figure out the rest when the time came. I live with my SO and am lucky to have very low expenses (<$500/mo) I've managed to save around 15k in the time I've been there.

We became good friends, we hung out and smoked up together. We went on road trips, out for meals and really got on really well. I stupidly moved too soon and within a few months of intense texting and hanging out, I told her that I liked her. She said her head was still in a mess and we put aside our amazing friendship for a while to ""cool down"".  The problem, is that nothing really cooled down, she picked right back from where we left off the following week as if the conversation the week prior had never happened.

Lots of texting, lots of flirting, still going out on ""dates that are not actually dates"" and alike. This has been going on a few months and I really really like this chick, but I dont want to move in too quickly again.

t3_4owjf3,"Education:

I am going to graduate this fall with a bachelors in Computer Science, with my girlfriend looking to graduate next spring with a bachelors in Food Science. She plans to get her masters in Business Administration starting fall 2017.

Financial Situation:

She needs to pay off her car with monthly payments, pay off student loan, and possibly her sister's financial needs. Her family may not be able to support her 13 year old sister, as the parents are getting sick. They might move out of country if they cannot work. I'm not sure when this can happen, so I'm really scared about the financial implications of my girlfriend suddenly becoming the guardian of her sister.

I just learned about the sister thing tonight and I am absolutely terrified. What can I do?

Financial Endeavors:

I would like to be able to travel out of country with her by our late 20s, as well as start looking for affordable houses on the west coast. Ideally we would have at least $2000 contributed each year to our IRAs and saving regularly. I want us to be debt-free and financially stable by 25, at most.

t3_4phvzz,"Hey folks,

My ex (we dated for just shy of 3 years) and I broke up about 6 months ago, and I was immature about it. Neither of us were happy in the relationship, but I told her I didn't want to be friendly going forward and basically never wanted to see or hear from her again. This is complicated by the fact that we live in the same neighborhood, went to college together and share some common acquaintances.

Even though breaking up was very hard on me, I also stupidly followed through on a macho impulse to act as though it didn't particularly bother me at the time and, when she asked me how I was so calm, told her that it just felt better now that we had made a decision.

So, I think this adds up to me having been a jackass. And I really regret it because I have no end of respect for this woman. I've thought on and off about reaching out to apologize because it seems like the right thing to do, but I don't want to weird her out now 6 months out from breaking up.

 I have no desire to get back together with her, nor do I think she'd be interested in dating me again. However, I'd love for us to be on decent terms and feel like I probably messed that up.

I anchored and we swam for about 20 minutes before someone came down to the shore and started yelling that we weren't allowed to anchor/swim there. They were really upset so I tried to be courteous and we left promptly.

I figured we'd get the boys back out on the tube and cruise around for a bit before heading home. However, the boat just wasn't working right... it wouldn't ever get up to speed. No matter what I tried I wouldn't go like it should.

So we abandoned the tubing and decided to head to the dock with visions of expensive repair bills dancing in my head. As we came in toward the dock I started prepping the boat (putting bumpers out, etc.). It was at this point that I realized my fuckup. Hanging from the bow cleat was my still-attached anchor rope! In my hurry to leave the swimming spot I totally forgot to pull up the anchor and been dragging the anchor all around the lake!

I sheepishly pulled up the anchor and was so flustered by my abject failure, that I made several more critical mistakes in docking and recovering the boat:
- I put the bumpers out, but then docked on the wrong side and got a few new dings in my gelcoat from the dock
- I forgot to lift the prop up all the way so it drug on the pavement as I pulled the trailer out of the water

A little backstory to begin, when I was a child my father bought 2.3 acres of property in a school district that he wanted us to attend in South Carolina. The hope was one day to build a house, however, as time passed that never materialized. We've owned the property for 20 years and over that time we've paid property taxes, sometimes late in the face of financial instability. Currently, we're doing better but still its an unnecessary financial burden and we'd like to capitalize on the property value having doubled since when we purchased, valued at $30,000 currently. We hired a realtor to sell the property a couple months ago but it has sat without much interest.  

We discovered our neighbors have been removing the for sale signs because they don't want someone to build on the wooded lot. We have left letters in the community's mailboxes detailing the problem. Without knowing which neighbor is doing it, we can't report them. Though the property is listed online, I'm pretty upset that there's not a on-site advertisement. In my frustration I was trying to think of alternatives while possibly irking the neighbors. I came up with an idea that actually was feasible and not too dramatic. We could either donate or sale the land for a reduced price and use it as a tax deduction; we considered Habitat for Humanity or Helping Hands. The problem, I know very little about about the tax deductions allowed/ how it would be applied. I read the full market value of the land is deductible but what does that mean in terms of tax refunds come next year? 

I want to do some good for the community; I have a BA in architecture and during college I was involved in community building and designed low income housing for those in need. My father has a similar sentiment but is business oriented and wants to reclaim his investment. I feel like this solution scratches both itches. Also, I would be lying if I didn't get some enjoyment at the prospect of inconveniencing the neighbors. Any ideas or information is welcome even if they aren't directly related to this idea. I just need advice on how to move the property with the maximum benefit for all (except those dick neighbors.)",aCMzb5a4UFnlycf71vTCuPTLxeDhTB,ref," If I donate a piece of land to charity out of spite, can I deduct it from my taxes and if so, how much of the value would be retuned as a refund (all, none, some?)",6.0
t3_4r447m,"Hey Reddit! Over the past week or so my SO of 6 months has been acting pretty out of the norm with me... We normally always say goodnight before bed and say we love each other but this past week it just hasn't really happened, I've said it but it's not been reciprocated at all. On top of this there's been this guy she's been talking to [26M] who she says used to be nice but then got weird and sends her nudes all the time but she has never told him to leave her alone. As well as that, she doesn't like being known as my girlfriend or that I'm her boyfriend even though we do all the stuff, spend time together, go on dates etc. But she changes so much around our friends, and this has not just been recently this has been since we started speaking to each other. This comes then today, she was at my house and she tried to initiate sex, after messaging the guy, I said no because I thought something had happened in the messages but she insists all the time that he's the only one being weird. Shortly after I apologised because I didn't want it to seem like I didn't want her and then she broke down crying saying that it was because she was gonna miss me a lot when she went to uni, but the thing is that she's never done anything like it before, whenever I've been upset she's always been comforting and said that we'd still see each other, so that prompted me to think further that something had been said in the messages and she'd acknowledged that I realised. She's now at home and flaming me for apologising and wanting a reason to initiate it, when before she did, nothing was going on, I'd went to get us a drink and we'd actually had sex about 2 hours before and both gotten off. I'm really confused about what's going on, please help.",uvzut5OK2bvei9zoCDdktcfLENYioY,sup4_ppo_rm4," My girlfriend of 6 months is acting weird with me lately, she's been talking to another guy and initiating sex, I've apologised but she's still mad at me over it.

t3_4r9izc,"I've [30 M] fallen into a relationship with a wonderful smart person for about 1.5 years.  In our year together I've found her to be an amazing and supportive person with a relatively good sex life (the year has been stressful for both of us so its been a little tough).  She is in the hard sciences and is extremely technical minded and thats great because we always have something new to talk about.  In addition to this we are long distance at the moment, but If my job hunting goes well I'll end up in a major city about 2 hours away from her (which I call a near distance relationship).

Now I know appearances are not everything but its not nothing either.  She is very attractive, however she does not wear clothing that is flattering to her.  She does not like to spend money on anything trendy for example eye glasses that might look a little nicer even though the serve the same purpose as her unflattering eye glasses.  She has also recently lost a bunch of weight so right now seems like a good time to address new cloths, because she is going to be buying some.

The problem is I recognize that her clothes and choice in accessories is a very personal choice.  But i'd also like to encourage her to refine her style and clothing, but it obviously needs to be things she likes to wear and feel good in.  I'd almost like to just buy her some cloths but... sizing and this kind of logistics seams weird.

t3_4rb09k,"So, backstory: I dated this girl for seven months. Nicest girl i've ever met, my parents loved her, just overall great. But I was an asshole: flirted with others at the beginning, stopped, and I broke up with her at the end because in our last month together I was talking to someone else and went on a date and generally cheated and was a bigger asshole. I found out she loved me, but I didn't love her, and I didn't want to continue this act and pretend like nothing happened, so I just cut things off, never telling her I cheated. 

""You're an asshole fuck you die OP""--I get it, but if I wanted to hear that i'd post in a different subreddit. 

Fast forward a while after we break up, we start talking again, as friends. We talk every day. One day I invite her over for conversation, next time i invite her for the same thing, we end up having sex. We do this a couple more times (with sex, or at least passionate making out). We flirt, but i usually initiate. 

Sometimes, I reflect on what I've done and realize I really fucked up. This girl was truly the best, and she regarded me as the same when I secretly was an asshole. But I'm afraid of commitment, and I don't think I'm ready for a serious relationship just yet. But I don't want to lose her, either.",uvzut5OK2bvei9zoCDdktcfLENYioY,sup4_6b," I cheated on my ex, we broke up, we started talking again, I have feelings for her, but I don't want to commit.",7.0

Last Friday I went to a workshop in another city (and am still here), and I noticed she just ceased all communication over the weekend. I sent her some messages asking what's going on, and she finally responded last night with the following sequence of messages.

her: Ill talk to u when u get back from dc

me: huh why

her: I have something i want to talk to u about but not while youre there so ill wait for u to come back first

me: i can Skype you now

her: No, ill talk to u when youre back

her: Oh, didnt see this

me: you said that already

t3_4rfdmq,"My fiancee and I (24 and 25) bought an investment property recently in a C neighborhood in Philadelphia.  Costs 70k, piti is 489, and we collect 1250 a month in rent.  So were cash flowing pretty damn well, have had no problems getting rent, and besides a bed bug issue no maintenance issues.  

Well, on Sunday, we went out with my fiancees grandparents for lunch.  They are old, wealthy wasps.  on the ride up, my fiancee's mom mentioned that the last time she went out to lunch with them (with two other members of their family) her grandpa had a fit about our rental property. 

 He was amazed that my fiancees parents would ""let us"" buy a property in Port Richmond (the neighborhood in philly), that it was a crime infested hell hole and that we were in over our heads.  The other two family members had to calm him down apparently, as they both were more familiar with Port richmond and knew that while its not the Hamptons, its not a horrible place and has started gentrifying.  

My main issue is the fact that her grandpa was essentially attacking a decision that we had both heavily researched, and has been working out fine, without either of us present to defend it, or give him the concrete facts.  Actually i'm having a hard time figuring out how that even came up without us there.

t3_4ryq2i,"We've been engaged for going on a year now, been together for 5 years. Im at work while she asked me to look up something on facebook. I forgot that she was using my phone earlier to log into Facebook because she couldn't find hers.

 So I go to the search bar and click on it to type in the friends name for the status she wanted me to read. Low and behold it shows that she looked up two guys yesterday that she had past one night stands with (well more or less booty calls ). I know this because we've both been very open about our past to each other.

 So I let my anger get the best of me and I confront her immediately through text. I ask her what she is doing on facebook and what's the reason that she is looking up these two guys. After much texting back and forth I get the bullshit answer that she was just nosey. I told her we'll talk about it when we get home. 

I get home and the conversation practically boils down to as previously that she was just ""nosey"" about what they're up to. I was told that it shouldn't really bother me and that I should be ""cool"" about the whole thing. 

Well im not fucking ""cool"" about it. I feel hurt and angry and jealous and confused all at the same time. I want to know why and nosey is an answer that just doesn't cut it for me. And on top of that, she claims that she looks at the one guys profile all the time because she grew up with the family during her childhood and she's seeing if any pictures were posted of them.

 Im not okay with this at all, I feel that there is something more. Maybe im looking into this too much but id like any insight that you guys can have for me.

t3_4s7fll,"My GF recently became my fiancee.  I am sure she's been planning this day for a while in her head, but the only two details I've heard so far is that it is a ""$60k wedding"" and ""the groom/his family"" pays for it.

t3_4sxfzv,"Hello,

When we first got together, my sweet and lovely girlfriend told me loud and clear that she equated watching porn to infidelity and that she would break up with me if she ever caught me doing it.

I admit straight away that I outright dismissed her message and continued watching porn on occasion; never when she was around and never on the expense of our sex life but behind her back and I often felt a twinge of shame. Yet, I kept on doing it.

It had to happen eventually. She discovered it yesterday and she has been devastated since then, sobbing uncontrollably for long bouts of time. Yet, she has also been kind, telling me how much she loves me and asking me rather than others for consolation (which I must say I feel very awkward about).

Immediately after the revelation, I owned up, offering her to break up with me because I realized what a let-down I had been. She turned it down, saying that she would stay with me, but it will be over if I ever watch pornography again. Nor can I break up with her, seeing that she has personal issues where my support is extremely precious to her. Walking away could destroy her.

There's not much more to say. She and I go along together extremely well and I have to count myself lucky that she still wants to stay with me and I will have to work hard to win back her trust. Although I do think her equation between porn and infidelity is forced, I absolutely disregarded her warning and now I am paying the price. Still, I feel wretched, branded an adulterer and I fear that our future relationship will be entirely on her mercy. 

There has been an incredible amount of anger and loathing over these past few days, but I now see that it is my responsibility to set things right. Still, should I just be completely meek in doing so or should I assert that, although I betrayed her trust, I haven't exactly killed anyone?

43, F, 5'0"", 170lbs, White (Non Latino), 10 yrs, abdominal, previous cysts & hysterectomy, no current meds

Around 10 years ago, she had surgery to remove a cyst (I forget what it's called, but she explained it as basically a fetus that ends up growing as a cyst - we weren't together then, so that's the best I can do). This was performed at a rural hospital, and poorly apparently. They told her that during the surgery, they accidentally nicked an artery or vein, and had trouble stopping the bleeding. The surgeon at the time told her that she had to use very large sutures, and following, she had bleeding for at least a couple weeks. Ever since then, she has had irregular bowel movements - in that, she is often constipated for days. Presently, she does show some signs of potential gall bladder issues, but the symptoms in question predate this by years. She has been dealing with abdominal pain and constipation since the surgery. I am wondering if it's possible that this surgical mishap could have cut off some blood flow to the intestines or some other part of the excretory system resulting in the symptoms... but researching this has been difficult. I understand medical terms, but my searches have mostly turned up home remedies for constipation. She has taken stool softener to minor effect, and magnesium citrate to almost no effect.

I don't have many friends, and lack family (I have one best friend) , so nothing is keeping me here anymore. I want to get a fresh start in a new area, where the people are friendly, plenty of job opportunities, and the weather is warm. I was going to go to school for health information management. The program is going to take probably a year to finish and I don't know if I can stay at my current job for that long. However, I don't think it's wise moving out of state with only having data entry and warehouse experience. The states that I was recommended were Texas, North Carolina, and Arizona.

t3_4txeim,"So the basis of my relationship with my current gf is stemmed through friendship. We were friends, she broke up with her fiancé, needed a place to stay and i offered her my spare bedroom. Granted it wasn't anything more than platonic until about 3 months in. Then it was on and off sex, and I gradually fell for her. Now the ex-fiance never really left the picture, but I didn't understand just how much of an issue it was until now. The only reason I went through her iPad to see the texts (we both have apple products only) was because her ex messaged me on Facebook and sent me some... not very pretty screenshots. However these didn't include a date or anything, so I opted to not believe him. But the seed of doubt was placed and it just grew from there. I honestly thought my girlfriend was only ever talking to me (while we were dating, she said this multiple times). We've only been official for about a month mind you, but I read some stuff that makes me question her feelings for me. Basically she never stopped talking to her ex (even though she claimed otherwise) and was also seeing another guy and telling him that she was ""falling pretty hard for him"". Don't chastise me for going through her texts, I feel like shit for it already. I normally don't do that, but something in my gut just told me to. The worst part is that we have a lease together and theres still about 6 months left. I honestly don't know what to do or feel. The only thing I can say for sure is that the ""sexting"" aspect of these texts really only happened before we were official.

My fiance wants nothing more than to go out to eat with me, come home and sit on the couch and watch a movie, eat cake or ice cream or something, and of course  open her nice thoughtful card and gift that I got her.

He told me he couldn't handle being so far apart from me anymore and it was causing him a lot of stress. I felt the same way too; I had a lot of anxiety, and so we decided to stay as friends. We still talked regularly as if nothing had changed, except that we cut the ""I love you's"" and pet names. But 2 weeks ago I found out that he has a new girlfriend. I was more upset about the fact that he didn't tell me about it. I suppose because we were friends now we could talk about anything, especially about something as major as that. He said he was afraid to ""lose"" me if he'd told me.

He still talks to me regularly. I try to avoid him when I can now. I thought he'd rather focus on his new relationship, and so I started talking to a guy on Tinder. We'd meet regularly, mainly for sex. At some point I just forgot to check my phone so I was avoiding calls and texts from my ex. He then asked me if he'd done something wrong because he felt that I was avoiding him. 

When I told him I was seeing someone, he became really upset/jealous and even said that I deserve better than a guy who just wants to fuck me. We talked for 3 hours about this, and he admitted that he still has feelings for me, that he really loves me but the distance is holding us back.

My boyfriend and I are both grad students and have been together for four months now. I absolutely love him. He's sweet, caring, tolerant, liberal, basically every single thing on my 'checklist', if I had one, is there. 

The problem, though, is he talks VERY slowly. I mean his speed is really slow. If I ask him anything, he takes about 3 seconds before he starts to talk, then when he starts, the words go at a very slow pace,and he even pauses for 3-5 seconds in the middle of his sentence. I get really impatient and sometimes just feel like telling him to hurry up (of course I don't, but I really feel like doing so). 

I asked him today, very gently, why he spoke so slow, and he said he just gets thoughts very slowly in his brain. He then went on to say he's just generally slow at thinking. I felt really sad when he said this, I don't know why. He's a Math PhD student,and we are at a pretty good school, and his research has been going slow for a while now (but this is totally normal in grad school), so I think that response was kind of a self-deprecating one since he's already low on self-esteem. 

Anyway, my point is, his speed of talking is just a part of him, it can't be changed. I love him so much otherwise but I just want to know how to deal with this.

Her visa to stay here is coming to an end later this year, then she will be forced to return to Malaysia despite opting to stay here if she had the choice. We have gone down the job route, to the point that she was offered the job here, but the employer failed to get a license to issue Visas on very petty grounds.

I (and others) have suggested getting married.

t3_4zatih,"already posted but im looking for more advice.

I am a non druze female who was in a relationship with a druze male, we dated for a year and for both of us it was our first love. Even though we're still young it truly feels like he's it for me and vice versa. However, recently we hit a crossroad and he decided to end things. Since in Druze culture you are unable to marry out of the culture and if you do you are no longer considered a druze, and then you and your family are looked down on and shunned in the community. However, some people i talk to say in druze culture it's different for guys and it may be acceptable for them to marry someone outside the culture. He doesn't really follow his religon/culture, he's just scared of how it'll affect his parents, he says he can't loose them or let them down. He doesn't want them to die unhappy, feeling like they failed. I really dont think they'd completely disown him, and i think he knows that, he just wants them to die content and they apparently can't if hes with someone outside the culture. But then if he chooses to abide his parents wishes he says he'll just be alone and not marry, meaning he isnt going to be happy... so confusing. But by being appart its destroying the both of us, im unable to move on and let go of him, i just can't give up hope. And he is regretting his choice everyday, but he's so torn.

My boyfriend who is a lovely person, but not the right fit for me in the long run due to various reasons including different interests and him seemingly forgetting to put effort into our relationship has panic attacks. 

He shares a very personal story which I greatly appreciated him trusting me with about how when the last girl he was seriously seeing ended things with him, he had a panic attack and ended up in the ER. He had to take a week off of work and had a very difficult time, eventually getting a psychologist. 

He has since stopped going to the psychologist.

I do not see things going well with him. I'm bored with the relationship and were about to enter long distance which I'm just not down for. It was suppose to be our last night together and he fell asleep early. By chance I ended up staying in the city but I was so fed up by the end of that night I decided it was over. 

I am extremely worried about breaking up with him. It's not that I think I am his God given world or anything like that at all. For all I know he could want to breakup too. 

We previously got in a large fight when we were drunk and I broke up with him. He said some extremely mean things about my health and I got up and said this is not what I need. 

He broke down crying and couldn't breathe on his bed. I ended up staying the night and calming him down. 

Things got better since but I can't see this relationship lasting forever and I don't think it's fair to stay with him.

When I graduated from my local College, I was instantly afraid of not being able to pay back my student loan debt. It was $30k in total, but I've always been pretty impoverish in my life, so it was a pretty *scary* number at the time. I spent a month trying to find jobs in my field, but knew that the pay I was receiving at the time would never match what my federal obligation would be.

So I jumped into a career in electrical work due to the fact that it was the only full-time position I could get in my area. I left my first electrical employer due to some stupid personal decisions on my end (job scams are the suck), but managed to enter the IBEW apprenticeship program.

Now, being in the apprenticeship program did help pay the bills, but I live in a Deep Red State, and our Union is weak as piss. While I had the chance to preform some degree related work for a year, my job negligence did cost me an opportunity with an employer. I never have been one to be good that the politics game. 

So now, I've been laid off the third time this year, due to contractors in our Local Union not having enough work for our labor hands.

t3_53cbi6,"I have bluntly communicated to him several times that I would like to see him more than once per week for two hours. He said he would try to make more time for me but it has not happened yet (I've talked to him twice in a three month period). We've been together five years, and I recently graduated from college and found a job. He literally works everyday and when he's not working he'll hang out with his brother or his friends to smoke weed. I don't smoke anymore, and I don't care if he does but I'm hurt that he barely finds time to spend with me. I don't even text or call to ask him to hang out because he'll usually say he's busy working. I know he's busy and throughout the week I'm busy with work too but we rarely talk. He'll probably send a text every so often, but we usually go 4-5 days without talking. Whenever we do hang out it has to be convenient for him and it's not fair to me. He works at out former high school's garden and does yard work for people which I can understand takes up a lot of time, but then again I don't. Sometimes the one day I do get to hang out with him, he'll cancel if someone calls and I'll be left at dinner/movie theater/wherever alone. I just feel like I'm not wanted and I wonder if I would just be better off single. I just want to re-establish the affection that used to be in the relationship; I feel like it's lacking. I've even told him I feel like I'm not wanted and he says, ""It's not that, I'm just busy"". I understand working and making money, but working EVERYDAY?

t3_54iqt6,"I purchased a condo about a year and a half ago and have been having an ongoing problem with the lady who lives downstairs. She smokes pot A LOT. She has told me she has a prescription for it; though we do live in an area where smoking pot is illegal. Her living room is immediately below my bathroom/bedroom. The building is old and has poor insulation which therefore means every time she smokes it fills my bathroom (and bedroom) with the smell of pot. When I first moved in I enquires with all the owners at a meeting (very small building and it's not professional managed) and each one claimed they don't smoke pot. I knew someone was lying as it cannot be smelled while outside, only inside my unit. One day I approached my neighbours door for something unrelated and was hit with the smell of pot as soon as I approached. She's since confirmed that she smokes pot but refuses to stop or smoke it outside. 

Beside the fact that I've never done pot and find the smell disgusting, I'm intending to apply for my city's police department. They have a very strict policy regarding drugs (for example, cutting out family members who do drugs, asking someone who rents to move, etc). I am very concerned that by ignoring this problem and smelling pot all the time I will be affecting my chances of being hired. 

I do not want to involve police if possible. It's a small building and this would cause a lot of animosity. 

I am looking for advice on how to escalate this and hopefully come to a resolution. I have already brought it up but she will claim she's not smoking and has no idea why I'm smelling pot. I'm not sure what my next steps should be (formal complaint, written complaint, etc)

t3_54j0yk,"Hi Reddit! I have a bit of medical history to address super fast, but I'll split it up. Thank you in advance. ( F , 18 y/o )

October 2015 I got my first UTI. They started to come back every 4-6 weeks. I was referred to see a nephrologist. He diagnosed me with kidney disease after having an ultrasound and revealing I have seemingly one kidney. Left has grown to compensate for the right that seems to have not worked since birth. Also had what they said to be a ""small stone"" in the right kidney.

I had then been referred to see a urologist if I got another UTI within the span of the next nephrologist visit. Well, I got one again. So I had a scheduled visit there before the nephrologist.

That was around June, 2016. Not much longer than a month, I had gotten sick from what seemed to be a stomach virus. All the symptoms. Lasted longer than 48 hours, which was strange. I had two ER visits due to pain and what I thought was bloody stool. CT scan revealed a cyst on my right ovary but that wasn't made a big deal.

Then a GI doctor referral. She scheduled a multitude of tests for me. My stool sample test came back positive with C. Difficile toxin B. I am now taking Flagyl for this. 500 mg 3x a day. I have an endoscopy and colonoscopy October 3rd.

Today, I've had a bit of pain in my lower abdomen very similar to what I would say UTI pain. I've had burning sensations when I've gone to the bathroom, too. I'm a bit worried and was wondering if I should see my urologist. The next time I believed I would have a UTI he requested I go to the clinic.

t3_54j4jn,"I'm a junior in college, and is (was?) really good friends with this girl for coming on two years now. For the past... almost 11 months at this point I suppose, we've been hooking up but remaining friends in a pretty weird situation. Well, I discovered she had feelings for me, and found that as I was coming into my junior year I had developed the same for her. It seemed like somehow we were actually going to avoid a messy friends-with-benefits falling out of sorts.

Anyways, she and I ended up having an open conversation about the possibility of dating. We decided that there was some stuff I had to take care of first, but we were both into the idea and agreed to be platonic friends until we would (really inevitably at this point) start dating.

And then, a few days after that conversation, I got really, way too drunk and made out with one of our mutual friends. Hoo boy. While this mutual friend and I talked and agreed it was a stupid mistake that we didn't want to repeat, my friend (rightfully so) became very hurt. She went home for the weekend and we stopped talking, but she came back basically saying that she didn't want to cut me out of her life, but that I had really broken her trust, I would have to build that back up, and that our friendship would never really be the same.

Honestly, I deserve all of it - even though it really was a stupid mistake and I would never in my right mind intend to do something like this, the fact is that I did it anyways while drunk and really did fuck up.

I don't know that there's much to do from here - while I'd really still like to date this friend, I can definitely see why that possibility could be off the table forever now. I guess at this point I'd just like to know if anyone has any advice for what to do from here; I'd like to prove to her that I do really care about her and build that trust back up.

It hurts to admit it, but it's true. We fell in love fast and hard, and were completely absorbed in our relationship for a while. And slowly it's just been fading. I love him, but I'm not in love. 

There's no romance. He always gets upset at me for things that shouldn't be an issue at all (like wanting to go out and have a girls night). He spends his days sleeping and playing video games, he has no interest in working or working out or taking care of himself (or me).

t3_caeo1,"When the internet began to pick up speed in the days of the 56k modem, I remember fearful talks about how this new technological tool would revolutionize the contemporary era. 

Outside of highly accessible porn, mass mp3 theft, and the rise of troll culture I don't really feel that the internet has lived up to its expectations. 

I look at the recent financial crisis, the BP oil spill, and the state of the US energy infrastructure at large and I can't help but wonder if the internet will one day provide us will an effective tool to apply collective social pressure to stop these travesties. It feels like a far off utopian ideal. 

Yet I see places like reddit full of people that at least seem like they care. 

In theory the internet is the ultimate tool for social connection and information exchange. This makes me believe that technological solutions are out there which we simply haven't bothered to enact. 

This then leads me to the thought that maybe if we collectively put our heads together we could either 1) devise a way to apply political pressure from the web or 2) organize to effectively solve glaring social and political problems ourselves (particularly since it is clear that banking and oil interests have a death grip on the current political structure).

The ultimate obstacle is then motivation to act (hence the title question). 

However I recognize the possibility that people may not want to put in the effort to change the status quo. There is also a distinct possibility that people enjoy the status quo enough to discourage the risk of change. 

Hence I ask, ""Would you be willing to start an internet spawned social/political revolution?""

t3_d2iki,"Ok, heres the story:

I was flying from Fortaleza (Brazil) to Stockholm (Sweden) with a connection in Lisbon on Monday evening. Once I got to the Fortaleza airport the flight got delayed a couple of hours but the TAP staff guaranteed us that we wouldn't miss the transfer flight in Lisbon even though it would be a very tight time schedule. Once in Lisbon we (pretty much everyone who was going to Stockholm) ran to the gate just to be denied boarding under the excuse that our luggage wont make it to this flight so we couldn't board, when asked if they could just let us board anyway and then send our luggage the TAP staff girl just said they wont do it. We all went to the transfer desk, pretty upset, only to find a huge line of people from other flights already complaining about their situation. From the 3 attendants in the transfer desk, only 1 was working and the other two just calmly said to us ""We cant help you, you should get in line and wait over there."" There were pregnant women, people with babies, elderly and everyone stressing out because it has been over 2 hours and the line hasnt move a thing. Soon enough chaos starts and I hear the TAP woman screaming to a customer ""You shut the fuck up! And you too sir!"" (in portuguese). 

Thats when I pick up my phone and start filming when a lady which was in line with us says: ""You better put that down, you dont have any permission to film here and if you continue, I am allowed to throw your phone away."" I said it would be illegal of me to publish it but Im filming it to myself and I can do it. She said she was from the press and she knows the law and I cant do that. I didnt want any trouble because it was already a mess over there so I put my phone down and told the lady to fuck off and so we stayed in line until after much trouble, we managed to get home the next day.

t3_dcg34,"Rather self-explanatory post, but just to elaborate a little further...

Has anyone, after working for a period of time, decided for whatever reasons to head back into academia to pursue a PhD in Computer Sc, with no intention to join the world of academia but intend to head back into the industry? If so, what were the reasons. Also, how did it turn out? Was there anything that you regretted? Did it work out?

The reason I'm asking for advice is because currently I'm employed full-time, and know how fortunate I am to have a job in these hard times. However, being from a foreign country and working in the UK, they are making it difficult for one to extend one's working visa because I do not possess a Masters/PhD and only a Bachelor's. 

It's just a little frustrating because I have been here almost half a decade now, but I have been sitting on a visa that has no count towards residency and soon, I will have to apply for a visa with even more restrictions. 

I'm thus considering boosting up my paper qualifications, so as to prevent myself from being in such a situation ever again. I believe the stipend from grad school actually pays almost as much as I am earning now (in terms of spending power, not direct currency conversion), but of course, given if I spent 5 years working as opposed to studying, there might be opportunities for raises/promotions.

Obviously, plunging into a PhD solely for that reason is bound to get looks of disapproval. I am, of course, interested in expanding my knowledge and having an opportunity to have time for myself. I have had research experience (published a paper, presented at conferences) so I'm aware of the challenges research presents.

A couple of days ago, I was at a red light, minding my own business when a cop car pulls up beside me into the left turning lane. I turn to look at the cop, and both her and her partner are staring at me. I just ignore it as the lights turn green and they turn left as I go straight.

t3_fkqf1,"So I did some looking around at different models of wrist mount GPS units. Cost and functionality were the biggest concern. I finally decided on the Forerunner 305 since it would do everything I wanted and was a good price (even though it's huge).

Best price I found online was through Amazon for around $130, with free shipping if I wanted to wait 1-2 weeks. It was available at the local Best Buy for $150. Did a quick search and found a printable coupon good for the month of February at Best Buy for 20% off all ""Health & Fitness"" products.

Went in to Best Buy and the price was $160 on the shelf. I found an employee (just happened to be a cute girl) nearby and told her I wanted to get the 305. She said she had that model and loved it...even more than some of the more expensive ones she tried (even though it's huge). She said she has run some marathons and we chatted a little bit about how I was just starting to run. She told me about some of the runs in the area, how the best ones tend to end with beer, and overall was very pleasant and informative while waiting in line at the cashier. I definitely hope to meet more cool people like her while pursuing this sport.

So I got to the cashier and the 305 rang up at $160 as expected. I mentioned the web site price was $150 and he price matched it. Then I gave him the 20% off coupon and it wouldn't scan. He tried typing in the number and it wouldn't take it. So he tried again and it accepted the coupon, but didn't apply the discount to the 305. He read the coupon, looked at the GPS, manually entered the 20% off and had a supervisor approve it. Super easy, out the door for $120.

The coupon should work on any ""Garmin Fitness GPS"" (that's an actual category on the Best Buy website), as well as any heart rate monitor or other brand of fitness GPS.

Later that day I hopped in the shower and, following a pro-tip I learned from Reddit, used my old loofah to scrub out any extra ...residue that might have gotten caught up in my butt fro. At the exact instant the loofah came in contact with my hole, I nearly passed out from the pain. It felt as if someone had sodomized me with an industrial cheese grader.

After about 5 minutes of recovering in this position, I finally regained enough courage to examine myself. I positioned a finger to where I thought my butt hole would be and discovered a shockingly large swollen abscess that was painful to touch and very tender.

One thing I love to do is make situations awkward/make friends laugh by emphasizing sight related claims. It's to the point that when I'm meeting someone new who uses words like ""see"" or ""look"" too much, I will occasionally stare back at them with a horrified look or even just a simple eyebrow raise and any friends nearby will start to laugh uncontrollably  knowing exactly what I'm thinking/possibly going to say.

Examples:

Friend driving me home from class last Tuesday night:
>Friend: ""Can you see gas prices going up any higher than they are now?""

>Me: ""No I can't *see* gas prices going up because I can't *see*m to remember where I parked the *car* that I don't own that I can't drive that doesn't exist because I'm blind.""

We are also trying to come up with hot-button words/phrases to include in this. So far we have:
 
* watch
* look
* see
* view
* visualize
* eye**s**
* observe
* focus
* **bi**noculars
* **bi**focals
* **bi**sexual
* Leela from Futurama
* glass**es**

For example, if I have a conversation with someone, instead of listening to what they are saying, I analyze the social iteration. In my head will be nonstop questions that play louder than the actual discussion. ""Does she think I am an idiot?""  ""Is he uncomfortable?""  ""Does she think I am creepy for making eye contact?"" ""Does he know I am not really paying full attention?"" There are a million other questions like that.

Even as I have become self-aware of this, I still can't stop it and focus. Its been a problem mostly when communicating with people, but has effected other areas of my life such as concentrating on a project at work.  Even now as I type this I can't really turn it off.

I think its most troubling when having sex. Instead of getting into the zone, I am constantly thinking about all this other bullshit.  How she perceives me, how animalistic it feels, etc.  The best sex (and perhaps social interactions in general), have always been drunk.  Being drunk is the only time I can really get into the zone and turn of the internal dialogue.

Is there anyone else experiencing this?  I'm sure everyone does to some extent but I feel other people have better control over it.

t3_hmu59,"And no, I don't experiment on my dogs.

My wife and I have fostered and rescued around 20 dogs over the past 8 years. We have 3 dogs that are ours, and right now we're dogsitting for my sister (who adopted our first real rescue.) We're also dogsitting for a friend of ours who adopted 3 of our rescues who had to take an emergency business trip to Columbia (and no, not for that white powder type of business.)

So right now we have 7 dogs in our house, but we've done that once before and can handle it.

The real story comes from last summer, when we rescued a mom and her pup from the crawl space of a house that was due to be demolished later that week. We kept the pup, who is one of our core three, and the mom went to live with our friend, and is one of the 4 we're now dogsitting.

The mom is some kind of husky/akita mix, but is relatively small for her size, coming in around 50 pounds. The son has that in him, as well as 50% German Shepherd and is huge, almost 100 lbs. 

What's amazing is that we've had this pup since he was 3 months and we haven't had mom around in a year. Up until we had them domesticated, both dogs were essentially feral. 

The similarities in how they behave is uncanny; the way they reach out for affection, how to crawl onto the bed to cuddle, nuzzle up for a pet, and follow us around to make sure we're OK.

t3_i8cxg,"I am a recurring problem-haver, it seems. My dog (whose previous issue was ankle-biting) is a 2 or 3 year old lab/basset hound cross. She was adopted from a shelter and has some separation anxiety issues (which we are dealing with), and is generally very very needy.

The trouble I am coming across in recent weeks is this: She sleeps in the bedroom, as she will NEVER be in a different room from me by choice, in her crate beside the bed. (Not closed in; that is just where she likes to sleep.) As soon as it is even sort of light outside, she begins pacing around the bed and whining incessantly.

At first I stuck with ignoring her and waiting for her to settle down and then giving her some attention (I didn't have any treats on hand, though maybe keeping some on the nightstand is not a bad plan). The trouble with that method is that she never actually settles down. She just gets increasingly louder until it reaches the point where she is flat out barking and howling.

I am concerned about this because when I do finally get up (as I have no choice but to do), I am probably indicating to her that whining and barking is the way to get someone out of bed. I know it is not a case of having to go outside, as she calms down immediately when someone gets up.

I am at a loss about the cause of this and how to fix it. Any insight would be much appreciated!",uvzut5OK2bvei9zoCDdktcfLENYioY,ref," Dog whines like crazy at dawn and just gets louder when I ignore her. I have to get up, but I think this encourages her to whine. Suggestions?",7.0

I am convinced that even though online job sites have openings in seemingly entry level jobs, that they really aren't hiring. After checking sites like craigslist (only restaurants, everything else  on there is pretty much a scam) and Indeed.com and applying to every position that I qualified for the only place that ever called me in for an interview was McDonald's... and they didn't even hire me! I even tried through a temp agency for a while to no avail. What really pissed me off about the temp service is that the only job they ever wanted to offer me was an over-night housekeeping position at a hospital. I have experience as a housekeeper but I was being upfront and honest when I said that housekeeping isn't something I was interested in doing anymore. I suppose beggars can not be choosy though. Just as I was seriously considering this job, I saw in the newspaper (hey, I was looking in every resource I could get my hands on for a job!) that they had not only one but two ads for jobs that I would much rather do than house keep! One was an administrative job and the other was a production job. When I had called to question why they never offered those positions to me (I was very poignant and called the temp service twice a week to see what was available); they said that was just so that they could get people in to put in applications! I said, why do they need more applications when they can not even find jobs for the people that have already signed up!

I'm already on diversion because when I was sober, I drove a drunk friend home, who happened to have weed on him when I was driving him home, to then be pulled over by the police.
I'm on a 90 day diversion, 1 UA a month, everyday I call to see if my 'Color' is called to go take a breathalyser test. Tonight, I decided to have 2 shots with a friend (it takes alot to get me even buzzed) who is getting married in a week and I can't make it. Luckily enough, my other friend who was taking us to a place to meet other friends, got pulled over with an open container and breathalysed, and thrown in jail.
I (being the good natured, newly renewed Christian I am(couple months,trying to turn a new leaf)) told the officer what happened the whole night.

I missed 3 days of work, and am just now back in the office. I scheduled an appointment with a physiotherapist this afternoon, but am not sure what else to do. (This is my first appointment- I could literally not leave the floor for the past 5 days, not even for the toilet, funfun)

The first chick replies saying they waited too long and they just ended up buying from scalpers!!! I couldn't believe it, those ungratefull bitches!

She didn't even have the decency to reply to my txt/email/phone call. Just straight up ignored me!

t3_lgx4e,"Hi Redditors, first post, figured I could get some advice.

Early this summer I started dating a girl whom I've known for about 10 years (met in middle school/high school, apart during college, started hanging out again once I returned home after college). When we started dating, things were really great, really easy, and went really fast. Within a month we were already so close and I could see myself marrying this girl within a year or two (I'm 23, she's 26). We get along great, spend decent time together, and I can tell that she really cares about me. She has all the qualities of a good spouse, good mother, good life partner.

We've now been dating for 4-5 months and things are starting to slow down and I'm becoming less passionate about the relationship. I want to be with her, but i'm not crazy passionate about it. I don't wake up every morning with a burning desire to be with her, crazy about being with her. I know that it's unrealistic to have this feeling every minute of everyday, but I haven't felt that way since the first few weeks of our relationship.

I also have to admit, even though it makes me feel shallow and a bad person, that my attraction to her isn't top notch. I am attracted to her, and we do have a physical aspect of our relationship, but she's not the most attractive women I know (or dated).

I should also mention that we are both christain and that God is a central part of our relationship. Its something that we can share together and has been a good way to bring us together. I've slept with 2 girls before, she's a virgin, we have decided to wait before marriage to have sex. I'm ok with it, though I do fear that it will have an impact on our intimacy (possibly a source for my lack of attraction?)

So what should I do? Am i expecting too much from the relationship? Is physical attraction an unimportant thing in the long run as long as we have an intimate connection? If I choose to ignore these feelings, will they come back to haunt the relationship later?

t3_m2dmp,"A little background information:
My condition was overlooked until now (19) due to a combination of what I assume was my intelligence compensating for the deficit and an aversion to the idea of ADD/ADHD by a great part of my family.

I first became interested in ADD while talking to a friend about her condition and, upon further research, diagnosed myself; however, that is another story.

This thread isn't about ADD and I don't want ADD to be discussed on it.  My question stems from a new found ambitious drive and the fact that, while medicated, I am able to better access and apply my mind.  A lot of my current inspiration comes from the idea of a renaissance man, Edmond Dantes, and The Most Interesting Man in the World.

Right now I am finishing up at college, but am going to grad school near my hometown (which happens to also be where X lives) for numerous reasons. I am probably one of the most ambitious people I know. I am really set on setting myself up to be successful in the future, and so far, everything is going according to plan for me. I have the connections I need for my chosen field and was even promised a job at my desired work location upon my graduation.

Absolutely nothing has changed with his situation in the last three years. Yes, there were a few failed attempts at a slightly better job then what he is doing now. But as I said, these were FAILED attempts.

When X and I first met, it was all fun and games. I had no idea what I wanted from my future so I wasn't really concerned about him not really doing anything all day everyday. But now that I am beginning to think about a career. I am much younger then X and I am getting started on this NOW. It hurts because I see that he might not be headed in the same direction as I am.

t3_optaw,"Alright, so I'm F25 and he's M27ish.

So one of my best friends and I met at a summer camp when we were both in primary school. She had a brother a couple years older, and the three of us would go on adventures across the neighborhood and wreak havoc in local playgrounds everywhere. Once high school started, my friend and I started drifting apart. Her family was incredibly religious and mine was becoming increasingly liberal in the changing political climate. Although our families remained friends throughout it all, I can't help but feel her parents seeing us as a bad influence. Although we lived down the street from each other, my friend and her brother were sent to private Christian schools for the rest of their education, giving me fewer reasons to see her or her brother.

Years pass, my friend's brother moves out of state for college, and she follows suite after she's done with high school, and I don't really hear from them until four years later when he moves back home and I decide to solicit his help on a website I wanted to make. I felt like we really bonded over this. He was really cool and incredibly helpful, funny, and smart to boot! Although he went to a private schools, he's very open-minded about civil rights issues, we have similar political affiliations, watch the same TV shows, and he isn't ashamed to like musicals.

My main problem is that I've had a history of horrible relationships. Not even horrible in the way most people think. I feel like there's a very strong chance I'm asexual. I've been in four big relationships that I felt helped me become the person I am today, and I'm thankful for it, but they all ended with the fact that I was unwilling to have sex with my partner.

I feel a sense of security with him, because I know he would never do anything outside of my comfort zone. However I don't start a lot of relationships because I feel guilty about not being able to satisfy my partners. One of my biggest concerns is that if he does wind up liking me back, and we start dating, and something happens causing us to break up, this could mean bad things for our family's already fragile relationship.

Over the last 3 weeks I've cut out soda and sweet tea completely, started eating more fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and less white bread, reduced my calorie intake (down to 1390) started doing cardio at the gym (3 mph on the treadmill at an incline of 1, for about an hour, every day). Thanks to this, I've lost 15 lbs from my starting weight of 268.

Now, I'd like to start strength training so that I'm not only losing fat but maintaining/building muscle so that when I finally do lose all this weight I won't just be a nasty, wrinkly mass of skin. I plan on strength training 3 times a week. 

While at the gym earlier today (last night?), I wrote a list of weight machines I should use and I just wanted to get peoples' opinions on my routine and if there are any other machines I should use or any muscle groups I neglected in selecting the machines. 

BEFORE anyone says I shouldn't use weight machines, I'd just like to say I'd prefer them because I'm uncomfortable using free weights and that's just that. When I'm more confident in my ability to keep form while lifting, I'll go to free weights, until then, I'd like to know that I'm not going to drop anything on myself or peel my muscles from my bones (I'm quite attached to them, you know!) because I didn't do something right.

R. is a constant show-off. He's had sex with 3 girls. 1 borderline chick who faked pregnancy every month, 1 ugly chick, who was another friends ex he kept bragging about, and his (now) ex-girlfriend.

The week after they broke up, he tells me he got a girls phone number. 'Lookie me, I'm hot stuff, I got a girls phone number! She was totally into me!'. I tell him grats, good for you, and carry on. 2 days later, he tells me he got 4 other phone numbers from extroardinally hot girls.

He tells me the story of how he got the number for each girl individually. By the third girl it's getting old, but eh, I'm his friend, so I'll sit and listen. He then proceeds to tell this same story to ALL our other friends, making everybody hear the story like 3 times.

R. is not a very good looking guy. He dresses poor, he IS poor, actually, and doesn't pay attention to hygiene a whole lot.

In December 2011, my wife and I made an offer on a home, which was eventually accepted.  The home was a foreclosed property, owned by Aurora Mortgage Services.  Closing date, dictated by the seller, was to be February 10th, 2012 (tomorrow).  We fulfilled our end of agreement - provided earnest money deposit, secured financing, obtained insurance, and as far as we were concerned were ready for closing.  As a matter of fact, title agency (again, dictated by the seller) contacted us and scheduled the time for the actual close.  However, on Tuesday, February 7th, we were notified that Aurora has placed all of their assets on hold ""until further notice"", but that periodically, properties will be ""released from hold"" - whatever that might mean.  
I've done some research online and came up with [this blog]  It appears that we are not the only ones currently dealing with this.
So now, our options are to file for an extension, or get our earnest money back and walk.  By choosing the later option, we loose out on the inspection money, appraisal and cost of gas that had to be turned on for the said two things (all together around $1,000).  We don't necessarily want to walk, because we like the house, but our current lease is set to expire next month.  We have no indication that this will be resolved by that point.

He ran a few television commercials last year and didn't have much success.  He has been doing a bit of online marketing and hasn't broken even yet on his investment for getting this all started.  He even packs and ships this product from his own garage.

The commercial for the product says ""buy one get one free"", but there's extra postage on the second item.  This is pretty standard on most commercials, and before someone checks-out online it clearly states the extra fees for the shipping on the additional item.

My dad received notice for a case that was filed by an attorney out of New Jersey (name withheld by me) who filed a class-action lawsuit against my dad because of the ""deceptive"" advertising.

This attorney ordered the product with the intention of filing this case, and I'm assuming the attorney keeps all the money he collects.

My dad ended up calling the attorney, and the attorney said this can all ""go away"" for $15,000.

Some background information: Over the past 4 months or so, I developed what I thought was a pretty close friendship with a girl whom I had known for the majority of my life, but had never really taken time to speak with until this year. In that time I discovered that she was an absolutely awesome person; very smart, and very funny and just enjoyable to be around. Up until just a few weeks ago we would talk for 3-4 hours a day on Skype, and I enjoyed all of it.

Now onto the problem: In the time I spoke to her, she mentioned Prom on several occasions, asking questions like ""Do you know what day Prom is"", also mentioning the occasion when other girls post dress pictures to Facebook, making it a semi-frequent topic for short amounts of conversation. Now I, lacking minor social skills, came to the conclusion that these were some kind of hints, and decided to man-up and ask her. After a relatively simple outing, on the way back home I decided that I would ask, and she proceeded to turn me down. In all honesty, getting turned down is not a huge deal, it is what follows that bothers me.

Since that day, she has not spoken to me at all, it has been 3 weeks now. She wouldn't return any of my texts (all three that I sent over those weeks), removed me from Facebook, and then removed me from her Skype contacts. She avoids communicating with me in person, and appears to avoid me now. There is nothing that I would want more than to continue on as we were just several weeks ago, but she appears to want none of it. I think I may have overstepped my boundaries in asking her to Prom, but being completely put out in the cold like this seems ridiculous, and frustrates me to no end.

t3_rs1y4,"Looking for some advice on the topic, or specifically if someone knows a good lawyer in the Riverside, CA area for this, that would be awesome.

My step son is having a kid, and the mother-to-be is the victim of harassment by him.  He has a history of domestic violence when he lived with us (I had him arrested as a minor), and he has a history of domestic violence with her.  They are unmarried, and he is now threatening 'all out war' to get full sole legal custody of the child when she is born.  He is even pushing to break a restraining order, and get an early judgement on visitation and custody rules.  

He has threatened to retain a lawyer, which there is a 75% chance he can not afford to do and is using it as a stalling tactic.  A new restraining order hearing was postponed today when he said he was retaining counsel at the end of this week, and it has been pushed to mediation (for custody issues, not RO issues).

He's great at playing the system and the people that work inside of it.  I am all for getting her a lawyer to fight against this but I am wondering just what we're in for.

He will not be named on the birth certificate.

I was looking for one of his friends who got married recently (couldn't remember her amended last name, but I knew they were facebook friends) so I went to his profile to check his friends and locate her. But I could only see our mutual friends. And I thought it was weird. And then I noticed that his profile was pretty much the only one where I could not see a complete friends list, so I'm thinking he's got privacy filters set. 

Now, I KNOW he updates his filters regularly (a long while back we were having some relationship issues, and I was blocked from seeing most of his profile for a brief period of time), and he has coworkers on his friends list and screens his posts from some of them.

I'm concerned because he's had a habit in the past of poor communication (which he has attempted to work on). But he does tend to close off, and if he DID have something he wanted to keep from me, this seems like one of the ways he might attempt to do so.

Is it acceptable to ask if it was just an oversight or if it was intentional? Is there a good WAY to ask? Is it possible/likely that it is just a mistake? Or is it possible he has something to hide?

I am a college student. My boyfriend (about the same age) lives in Australia, and so far, our relationship has purely been an online one.

Because of this all of my friends are awkwardly her friends. Either way, when we ""broke up,"" but it was a soft break... I kissed her goodbye before I got on my train home from uni for winter break and she went home and is away this semester for an internship. 

This semester has been hard because I tried talking to her online, not realizing that we were actually broken up for sure (not just breaking because of distance). At the same time she dumps more reasons on me as to why we have broken up. Throughout this I got aggravated, because she was not upfront when we broke up. So after telling me she needs sometime to find herself and be single (100% no ties to me). She gets an OkCupid and is now going out with a guy long distance at another uni in my area (Northeastern).

  He's applied for about two hundred jobs, with no leads. He's been late giving me rent for the last two months, and he still owes me one hundred from last month. When I tried to explain that I was worried he didn't respect how important rent is, he quickly got upset, and stormed off into the night to find an ATM. Over the phone, i've begged him to come home- it's about 2am here- but he maintains that I just want his money, and ""everything is about money"" to me. For the record, it's not, I would pay all of the rent if he told me ahead of time he couldn't afford it. I'm worried about him walking for miles in a strange city so late. 

 His ego has been wrecked lately, because of lack of work and unhappiness with his appearance. He dislikes how he looks because his hair has gotten shaggy, but he doesn't have money to cut it, and refuses my offer to pay for one. I think I may have hit a sore spot when I asked about the rent. He has been feeling inadequate lately, and this may have rubbed salt in his wounds.

t3_uejp1,"I dated my ""first love"" in High School during a very turbulent period in my life. I came out to my family as bisexual, and had come out to my friends as transgendered. My girlfriend then was super supportive. She called me by my new name, and she she immediately used all the right pronouns. She encouraged me in the face of adversity.

Then it just ends. I get home from a short trip abroad, and she breaks up with me. She says she just doesn't love me anymore, and that's just all there is to it. I am crushed.

So I am dealing with all of this when my best friend at the time tells me he needs to ask me something. Turns out he wants my permission to start dating her. This isn't months or years later, mind you, its only a few days. Wanting to be a good friend, I say yes. A mistake on my part.

It kills me to see them together. He takes her out to do dates that I never did because she told me she hated it (nights on the town doing nothing but walking around, for example). Within a week they are officially dating. Its senior year of High School and I just lost my two best friends to each other.

And then the clincher to it all. He convinces her that me being trans is just an act I do for attention. She, for whatever reason, believes him over me suddenly. So I am suddenly without my two best friends, and my safety net for all the insecurities that I deal with in only recently having come out to people.

R= my good friend who I met from college. (22)
A= R's best friend, guy I am currently dating. (22)

Anyway, R and I started hanging out and talking to each other around December of last year. Eventually I met A in February of this year and we started going on dates in March. We slept together in May...obviously we moved a bit fast but we both didn't really find it an issue. We saw each other a lot, whether it was just the two of us hanging out or the trio all together. In early May, R had to go away for military training for 2 weeks. In those two weeks A and I got pretty close emotionally, with him sharing some personal stuff with me, showing me childhood places of memory, etc. But when R got back...things were different. All of a sudden we see each other maybe once or twice a week instead of the 3 or 4 that we did. We started having sex less.  The texting/messaging/effort to talk to me slowed down. Compliments are slowed down as well.

After two weeks in the nicu and a month on heart/lung monitors at home, she completely caught up and surpassed pretty much every growth metric for actual age (forget about adjusted!).
Now, at 4 1/2 she's reading books designed for late first-grade and doing late-kindergarten math, mostly just on her own volition.

I feel like she may treat him the same now when she says things like that. 

She emailed him a while ago that she was coming to visit him. He told me of it immediately. She hadn't given any details but made it seem like her trip all the way was just to see him. I was uncomfortable and wasn't even in town at the time and expressed that to my boyfriend. He immediately told her not to come see him because I said so. It was only then that she revealed that she was visiting her family there along with her current boyfriend and it wasn't a trip just to see my boyfriend. 

I was a little embarrassed of this... but still feel like my boyfriend shouldn't have so bluntly told her it was my fault!

t3_wacek,"25f. 

About five years ago, I briefly dated someone my age before leaving for university abroad. We promised to write, to somehow make it work, but two months into the LDR it I realized it was too difficult and we barely knew each other, so it was too big of a sacrifice. I wrote him a sweet but realistic letter and broke it off. Six months later I met the guy (also my age) who I got into my first serious relationship with, we've been together for five years now. He too eventually dated someone he's still with. 

When I returned home one summer, he immediately dumped his gf so he could ask me out, but I was taken and I wasn't cool with stealing someone's boyfriend, so I said no and he got hurt. 

After all this time I find out today that he thought I had first dumped him because I cheated on him. I didn't! Half a year passed before I dated someone again! And it seems petty compared to other problems on here, but I'm really bothered by this and I wish I could set the record straight. I didn't dump him because I cheated or met someone else, I dumped him because it was right, and from a long term perspective, I did him a favor.  But I can't set the record straight because so many years have passed, and I dread being ""that"" person. I just wish he knew I was truthful to him when we were together. 

I'm torn. Is my gut right about this? Or should I tell him?

My friend pulls into a restaurant and drives up to the little intercom thing where the employee's can take your order. Without even waiting for the voice to ask, ""How can I help you today?"" or whatever, my friend says, without any hesitation,

""Let me get two McChickens, a big-ass sweet tea, and McFlurry, BOUNCE.""

And then immediately drives up to the first window. I'm cracking up at this point, and we are both watching the guy through the window quickly looking around and trying to figure out what happened, as he was somewhat unaware an order had even been placed.

Once the employee saw the kid with the wife beater and backwards snapback hat on staring expectantly at him through the window, he started laughing and then took his order again.

She was so nice to me. She invited me to her parties and her friends - even thought I didn't know them very well - were just as nice as she was. I had so much fun. But we saw each other less and less.

t3_wx3g6,"Through my studies (bachelors), I have become more and more disturbed about the ""scientific"" nature of finance. 

Quick, what percentage of mutual funds ""beat the market"", i.e. perform better than the index? Studies generally find the number to be between 20 to 30 percent, but in 2011 the number went down to 14%. If these people are so armed with expertise and knowledge, why do people who don't understand anything about financial theory get more just by passively investing in an index fund? If anything, financial ""knowledge"" seems to do more harm than good.

When looking at the stuff they teach in universities, you have to wonder how they keep on believing these theories despite the mountain of counterevidence. Stocks are assumed to generate returns relative to risk, quantified as beta in CAPM. Yet, beta has had almost zero correlation with stock returns starting in 1982. If you look at the studies that confirm beta's predictive power, they all used data from the 1970s. But people still use beta to create portfolios.

How about efficient market theory? Under the theory, stock bubbles should not exist since everythingn is properly priced. But they do exist. Instagram valued at 1 billion despite having no revenue? Definitely properly priced.

Even option pricing models are ridiculous. One model assumes that you can borrow money at the risk-free rate and stocks only generate risk-free rate returns. The black-scholes model also assumes that risk is normally distributed, without looking at historical data, leading to black and scholes' own bankruptcy. 

Wanna know how we price stocks? We pull magic numbers out of our asses and make it interact with other equally bullshit number to come up with an arbitrary value. Then we try to convince other people that our bullshit is, in fact, legit. The only way stock valuation models are accurate is if stock analysts are clairvoyant and can see 10 years into the future.

I'm 27 and she is 28.  We've been together 2 1/2 yrs. and we live together.

Yesterday she got mad at me over the phone for not wanting to go to the beach the next day (she was on a lunch break). After we hung up she texted me and said I never try to spend time with her. I apologized and said let's go. She said she was over it and will go with friends. 

After that she texts me and says she is going out after work with friends and wont be home until late. She also said she can't go to my friends wedding next week. 

She doesn't come home  till midnight last night and when she walks in she doesn't speak to me and proceeds to watch tv in the living room and then she slept on the couch.

t3_yedtm,"To begin, and give context, it seems now two years after graduating high school that I am just sick of where I live. (No this isn't a *wah me* post.) So, I have always had the attitude, that if I don't like something in my life, I want to change it. 

I don't like being around people I grew up with. I am subscribed to my city's subreddit, and it seems that people only talk about where they would rather be, due to extreme heat and lack thereof things to do.

However, now I am asking you redditors for help and to see how you guys have moved on your own.

Beyond actually *deciding* which city I would want to move to, (I have narrowed down my decisions,) I need help on how to finance the move because right now, it seems completely unrealistic for meand it pains me. I feel somewhat trapped here. Now I have the transportation to move, and I could quite possibly put down one months payment on my lease. However, only being a college student, I don't have the experience to be considered for a job that one could just accept via the telephone. I would need an entry level job. It seems I would need a job previously to moving, because I can't spend weeks without pay scrambling to find a job.

I find myself in a catch 22.

I need success stories. Have any of you redditors out there moved all by yourself without the help of affulent parents or have handy tips for me to make my dream a reality?",r3rJgaEN7p04d65VAVAejoMN02DsM9,sup4_12b_t0.7," I want to move to a different city.

t3_yi3jj,"A couple months ago I went to Miami with a female friend of mine. Little did I know I would encounter creeps everywhere - literally men waiting on the side of the road to approach us at night. On the second day there, we were walking to the parking lot to add more time for the space. It was about 6PM and there was a lot of foot/road traffic in the area. I can't remember if I was looking down at my phone or not, but my friend was walking a few feet ahead of me. Suddenly, a couple of guys pass me pretty close and I hear an aerosol spray and smell nothing but ether/paint thinner (no idea). Almost instantly I feel nauseous and have a strong head-to-toe light headed feeling, like I'm passing out. When I caught my breath I turned around and saw the two guys lingering by a parking meter watching me, then they walked away. My friend didn't see/hear anything happen, and I didn't tell anybody else walking around. I instantly felt freaked out and didn't feel right for the next hour. Needless to say, I left that night. I felt like I was in Taken 2 and there was no Liam Neeson to save my ass.

I should clarify that it's never excessive, violent, or directed at me. I kind of admire his assertiveness sometimes. A lot of people would probably see this as a reasonable level of emotion, but I have some problems dealing with it.

As I mentioned, I (24) am a doormat. I very, very rarely get angry at anything. My usual response to conflict is to curl up into a ball and cry.

t3_ythd3,"we've had our share of problems but we overcame everything.

over the last year i started to be too active in my own activities and i stopped showing intrest in her activities. i did not do this knowingly! she also didn't realise it so we couldn't talk about it 

last wednesday we were talking about how our relationship changed over the last couple of months and how we became to much as normal friends. the reason was my behaviour, my neglaction of her, made her lose intrest in me in a intimate way. 

she is everything to me and i wanted to do whatever it takes to stay together with her but i can't seem to make her believe it can really be done in the long run. 

we agreed to stay friends, but in trying to make her believe i can change, i would only push her away from me and the thought of her being completely out of my life terrifies me more than anything

t3_z2l2d,"Seriously, I'm an idiot for getting myself into this.

When I fall in love I just automatically give the person the benefit of the doubt, and my trust. Y'know, I thought if you love someone then that automatically means you should be able to trust them. If he tells me he doesn't trust me because he's scared, I'd just believe that shit without a second thought. 

Am I really that much of an idiot to just believe that? This guy is totally fucking around, I can't believe I'd be stupid enough to believe otherwise just because of love and just because *I'm* faithful. Stupid, stupid, stupid.

But now, I'm just going to numb myself out. I'm really good at that. I'm going to constantly assume the worst. I'm going to allow myself to keep falling in love with him (because honestly I couldn't stop myself if I tried) and I'm going to stay just as faithful as I've been this entire time, *but I'm not trusting him for shit*. Fuck that.

I already know what's coming. I've probably been getting played since the beginning, and I'm definitely being played now. I'd be a fucking idiot to think this guy actually loves me. 

I mean really, why did I think I was special? What made me think I was so special that he would want to be with me exclusively? I only believed it because that's what I wanted, but what the fuck? Could I be a bigger fucking idiot? Damn.

I'm just going to enjoy it while it lasts. Sooner or later it'll get more obvious that I'm being used and I'll be discarded, or the betraying will become apparent. Whatever comes first. So at least for now I can love him without being fully aware of how I'm being fucked.

It'll actually be cool to get my heart broken because then I can really numb out. Any faith I have in people would be sucked out and replaced with cold detachment. I'll shut people out of my heart in the name of defense. If I don't trust anyone to begin with, then they would have no chance to fuck me over.

We were poly (well, she was; I never dated outside of the relationship), and she'll post updates about how great her current partner is, especially compared to ""some of her exes,"" and referring to details of our relationship that I'm sure to get. I'm sure you've seen this sort of behavior, someone talking about how great things are now compared to *before,* how great it is to be finally understood, etc.

t3_zoy3j,"So, my best friend, who I've had a crush on for about 2 years, has started getting really flirty with me. There are a couple of reasons why this is weird to me.

First, we've been friends for about 3 years, and has never seemed interested in me. When I first told her about my crush on her, she got really distant, and it took a while just to be comfortable around her again, but now our relationship is as strong as ever.

Second, she's really involved with another guy, who I personally think is below her standards. However, I try and stay out of the relationship as much as possible and just let them do their thing. However, she has gotten more and more flirty with me as she has been dating this guy.

She is very, very uncomfortable with touching other people, but recently (as in last weekend), began to put her arm on my shoulder, tickle me, hit me playfully, and is allowing me to do the same. This morning in class, i was tickling her, and she was perfectly fine. Then another of her friends put their hand on her shoulder to ask her a question, and she freaked out.

I've also noticed that she has started talking really quietly around me, forcing me to move my head in closer so I can hear her. When I do this, she flits her eyes between my eyes and my lips. I've also caught her looking at me from across the room quiet often, and even though we are good friends, she looks away as if she's really shy or embarrassed.

I think she may be developing a crush on me, but maybe I'm just becoming really close with her, and she is just becoming more comfortable with me. Any thoughts? Also, if it becomes obvious that she does indeed have feelings for me, is it appropriate to make a move while she is with this other guy (their relationship is about 7 months now)?",gMlGeJl1vsMERrbmC7W717zpVevUh8,ref," Old friend is being really flirty with me.
